48556,when is it time to get help so this is officially my first post on reddit ive silently observed a while bunch of posts over the years but never actually participated in anythingi have a question for people who are depressed and got help at what point did you know you needed to get helpi dont want to be attention seeking in the least neither my friends nor i would peg myself as a sad or depressed person in any way but i often find myself overwhelmed by sadness  debilitated to the point of not wanting to move off the bed for hourshaving been unceremoniously ejected out of and immediately replaced in a  year long relationship that lasted my entire adult life the effects have been exacerbated on valentines day but this happened in october  and i should be okay now right she was honest enough to tell me she was leaving me because all this was too intense and her new boyfriend is airy and breezy but thats just gone ahead and discouraged me from ever trying to be with anyone again nobody should have to go through what my ex went through dealing with me this in turn has shut down my only hobby playing guitar badly given how most of it was playing and singing songs for herbeing an international student hasnt helped either im away from my family and cant freak them out with any of this from thousands of miles away im very good with code top of my class ahead by miles with minimal effort but just cant seem to land a summer internship  rejects have sent me further down this rabbit hole i can deal with it but god damn it really stings ive got lots of second opinions on my profile from faculty and industry veterans who attributes this to just plain ol terrible luck skill has no role to play in getting calls for interviews apparentlya lot of people around me are worse off though but instead of the misery loves company approach this makes me feel terrible because they seem to have their sadness under control with unwavering determination to succeed even though they are sad for a day or  every time im faced with this level of sadness im completely devastated this has happened before but i had my ex to help me through itself harm hasnt set in but one day i was trying to find out how life insurance payouts work and if mine can compensate my parents for my rather lavish expenditures as an international student not that they needed it too desperately im too much of a coward to do anything but knowing i have options justmakes me feel better the idea that i can end everything in case things go sideways and not smiling ironically gives me strength to get on with things in lifethis is going to get some serious hate here but im a huge futurama and rick and morty fan because the trivialization of our very existence is the most fascinating theme ever but the nihilism involved just makes me feel worse religion makes me laugh so thats out of the questionbut i really have to mention here that i can be a fun person i have loads of friends who have helped me tons after breaking up and i love them all no childhood issues either loving parents and the coolest sibling in the history of siblings so i cant tell if this is a temporary slump or if im actually dealing with something i need help withdepression is very taboo where im from so i cant discuss this with most people i know and so here i am on reddit asking random people ive never met before to evaluate my psyche and determine if i need helptldr mostly happy person but been very sad for months how to tell if i need helpps general suggestions on how to shake this feeling are also welcome ,3.0

48570,my therapist wants me to take meds but the prospect terrifies me ive struggled with various levels of depressive and obsessive thoughts for years but its become worse this year and my therapist thinks its a good idea for me to try ssris she thinks that a lot of the usual therapeutic modalities are actually feeding into my obsessive loops and making me feel more depressed and that the peace of mind i could get from meds would help me be able to face stuff more in therapy and take more concrete steps toward recovery the idea of being on meds though scares the shit out of me the idea of doing anything consciously mindaltering is really frightening i dont even drink wine let alone purposely let loose and get buzzed or high the one time i ever got buzzed was one time when my drink was spiked and it was awful i know that being on meds wouldnt be like that but honestly the idea of me not being in control of my own mind terrifies me i mean my mind is me isnt it i could handle it if im able to change the way i think gradually and with effort which is of course why i started therapy in the first place but the idea of me being at the mercy of a drug and not knowing what im going to feel like or think like or be like at the end is just really scaryof course im also looking into things like potential side effects increased suicidal risk etc but this is the thing thats really holding me back and i was wondering if any of you might have any insight into this thank you all,3.0

48579,i feel like im going back to where i was a year and a half ago hi this is my first post in this subreddit so if im breaking a rule or something like that please let me know im  years old and i live in italy im saying this last thing since im going to talk about some things that i dont know if are the same in other countries like the school system for example one year and a half ago i was really struggling with depression after i finished high school and due to problems with finding an apartment in the city i was supposed to go to since its a small city with a high demand for apartments especially from students so after searching for an apartment for something like  months i started even before finishing high school i gave up that university and i did absolutely nothing from september  to march  that was one of the worst periods of my life i wouldnt do anything except for laying in my bed eating shitty food and binge eating or not eating at all there was no middle ground i wouldve probably ended my life if my girlfriend wasnt there for me during that time and im lucky that shes still here to this dayafter that period i got a job and everything went better i didnt love the job and i didnt want to do it for my entire life but it wasnt bad i was making some money and the people there were fantastic every day i spent there was fun because of those people i worked in a warehouse in april  i decided to apply to another university completely different from the one i wanted to go the first one was a video production university the universitys name is something along the lines of university of arts music and spectacle long story short i got accepted at this university and i started going to it in september everything was fine the university is one of the best in italy and its also only a  train ride from where i live so i didnt feel the need to look for an apartment everything went great for a week but then i started feeling that i didnt like it at all i didnt like any of the classes and still dont since as i said before its a completely different university than my first choice and has nothing to do with cinemaphotographyvideomakinguniversity has started again on february the  since winter break lasted from the  of december to that day during that winter break youre supposed to give at least three exams i didnt give any exams because of how i was feeling then and how im feeling at the moment and since the university started i havent been to a single class simply because just thinking about those classes puts me in a really bad place and completely switches my mood so much so that any time i see the universitys website or just glance at the schedule of the classes i feel that my stomach is upside down i would wake up in the morning look at the schedule and just cry then go back to bed staying there until  on a good day and until night on a good day it also doesnt help that i have generalized anxiety panic attacks and insomnia i dont know what to do i feel like im falling back into depression even though im not sure about that i want to drop out economically it wouldnt be a problem since in italy universities are affordable and i pay €year so im not looking at any debt or anything like that i dont know what to do i would go to a psychiatrist as my psychologist advised me to do two years ago but i cant afford it and once again i would take my own life if it werent for the fact that theres my girlfriend and it would crush her to pieces if i did and shes also the only real reason im living for at the moment what should i do how can i get out of this please i need help ,3.0

48649,how do you deal with depression in school i cant believe my own emotions right now i decided to finally speak to disability services before this semester i was diagnosed with anxiety depression and agoraphobia im taking two uc prep courses had a test today and forgot to let dss know about it so took it in a classroom setting the hassle of private testing gives me more anxiety had a panic attack before the test no clue how i did had a lab after and did shit on it hands were shaking and i was still feeling shitty from the test anxiety get home at about  tired and dead and burst into tears in front of my boyfriend i still need to study for a quiz for my math class tomorrow morning and i know i wont study enough to make it if i even try this the worst ive ever felt in college and ive been doing it since winter  ive been crying every night for a week my sleeping schedule is fucked as i stay up crying from stress i nap in the day time and it screws up my days might drop my calculus class because ive been failing all of the weekly quizzes and the grade is solely based on quiz and test scores this would result in a shit load of money taken from me from fafsa loss of pell i think and obviously not advancing with what i think i want to do i dont even know its safe to say that i cant remember the last time i was this depressed maybe in highschool when i had an abortion im having self harmself destructive thoughts creep up on me i find myself hoping to get into an accident on the way to school and die the only thing keeping me sane is my boyfriend he holds me and tells me its alright is supportive of me possibly dropping my calculus course he loves me and thats all i have in life i barely know my family anymore i have no time to socialize i have no time to write do art  do yoga and meditate and read books which i used to occupy my entirety with and love i have no time to work on building my van so i could camp out in it i feel like my life isnt set in the right direction due to this stress but im not sure if my mental illness is dictating everything im having to sacrifice my mental health and wellbeing for a passing grade its not sitting well i am going to make an appointment with a school counselor and psychological service counselor to understand better where i sit thats all i can do for myself,3.0

48671,just need an outside opinion so a little preamble  after my brother had a pretty spectacular meltdown that cost him his job my family got around to talking openly about mental health we have a long history of mental illness going back at least three generations but up until last week we never ever talked about itanyway while im a little older than planned im currently studying for my degree   after my problems finally boiled over in  and basically cost me a whole year i had to come back and resubmit some things for my final due to a prescription error i ended up off my meds for the entirety of last month during that time i accomplished practically nothing due to withdrawal and suicidal impulsesmy final paper is due in a few weeks by my calculation if i pushed myself to the limit could use what i have and likely finish it within that time however i would be putting myself under tremendous stress and it would be a piece of crap that would at best barely pass before i came to study i had a low paying job that i really enjoyed and felt happy at least for somebody with longstanding depression doing im now considering abandoning the degree and trying for my old job again after the first real open talk with my family in years i realise they would be supportive of what i do no matter what however i also feel that after the five long years it took me to get this far i owe it to them my girlfriend and everybody else who supported me to at least tryim going around and around in my head and i guess i just want an outside look do i push myself to the limit and risk breaking again for a slim chance at a degree im not sure i still want or do i hope everyone supports me spare myself the pain and go back to my old life,3.0

48681,can life really get any better i finished school a year ago and started university i made the decision too fast since i just wanted to leave my hometown because i didnt have good friends there i always struggled with finding friends in school i got bullied for a time for my appearance in my last year i found really great friends but in the end they hurt me the most although i explained to them that what theyre doing isnt good im not sure if they were aware of how they played with my mind or if they just didnt care by that time i lost a lot of weight too by eating healthy and i was happy with my appearance but still i was shy and kind of anxious i used to be very scared of buying food in school breaks because it would have meant i need to talk to a stranger so i just starved until i was homewhile the last exams started i got into a new group of friends and i met a boy there i really liked but he was in a relationship with one of my friends obviously i never told him but we had a lot in common and i felt some kind of connection because he told me that he used to be as shy as i was but managed to change he said he might help me to become more confident too what i didnt know was that he liked me a lot too it ended up with him kissing me on my prom him telling his girlfriend and therefore breaking up and ruining our prom i guess i feel really bad because of it i feel guilty although i kind of wished for something like this basically like in all these teenie movies where the unpopular girl gets all the attention on prom finally blabla but i didnt want a relationship to end because of me i didnt want to be a cheater i wish he would have broken up with her before starting anything with me and now i lost a possible chance of love and my friends so when university started i was too scared of the other people i didnt go to the parties since i knew it usually ends up with me crying in the bathroom therefore ofc its my own fault i couldnt find friends and no one talked to me i knew it cant stay like this so i went to a party from my sister everything was alright until more and more people arrived and i didnt know anyone and couldnt talk to anyone i left early and spent the next day in my bed doing nothing soon i realized that i dont like my courses and i wanna drop out of uni and start working first till i know what i want to do i didnt have bad grades in school but im completely lost in this giant pile of jobs and unis im losing motivation to do anythingmy mom thinks im weird bc i dont talk to anyone she isnt wrong but the way my sister and mom talk about me hurts me a lot and make myself think im weird and useless i wish they could understand how i feel what ive been through and why i might be scared of social interactions i always thought my sister would understand me more since she has light depression but she literally called me retarded lolby now im just wondering what is my purpose i dont even have any goals i dont enjoy the things i used to enjoy i used to be a gamer and now i touch my computer maybe once in  months for gaming i dont talk to my online friends like i used to i used to draw a lot read and write but now im just watching youtube in my free time maybe so i feel less lonelyeverything is changing to the worst basically and i just want to have a purpose i am scared that i fall deeper into this by everyday i dont expect anyone to read this whole thing but i felt like i need to share this with someone if you actually read this thank you,3.0

48818,maybe yall can give me job ideas ive tried asking in a few other forums but i got attacked and ridiculed for the perceived flaws of my thinking process and didnt get much in the way of ideas i also maybe wasnt articulate about my position in life so ill try here i figure this crowd might be a little more forgiving if my internal thought process could be perceived as problematic oh and im no interloper im thoroughly depressed my backgroundive been fired from jobs  times now im  living with my parents i do have a retail hourly job but the hours are very few this is tough from a standpoint of my personal pride with an emphasis on the fact that i come from a rich family that includes my brother and father having gone to an ivy league school when i was a sucky teacher we stressed the importance to the lowerincome kids of getting a college degree to make a better life for yourself so here i am with a college degree looking at shitty lowpaid manual labormy hangupsso its a bummer for me to think that i should stay away from intellectual jobs that give me crippling anxiety since that will inevitably lead to failure but thats how i feel and honestly no kindergarten slogan about positivity is going to magically make things better i cant stand the thought of being responsible for just about anything as i have a very strong fear of being judged negatively i hate the idea of creating anything and presenting it to the world which is why i never took serious risks back when i was a journalist of all jobs but i want a job and ive been sitting on this for well over a year i am too anxious to take on a real job but too proud to take the leap into menial work id try to justify myself to yall but no its naked classicism aside from the lesser money made by manual labor there is in my mind a huge stigma that comes with it and for me an admission of failure to the outside world that ive given up trying to be successful and that i literally cant handle challenging work that with my programmer brother and chemical engineer father i cant hold up a job and im a big failure at life so now im doing petty shitugh but because of real life i need a job that pays more than my  a week retail job the retail job doesnt give me even a fraction of the stress of the other jobs and its shown me that im not actually lazy you see when the work is clearcut and dictated to me ill just do it for hours on end period when it involves creativity and intellect ill sit on it and play games on my phone etc money is money and id like more of it side note its hard to look cool on tinder without fulltime work and a place of your own feel free to skip the above and just read this look yall got any ideas jobs that might pay halfdecently that i can reasonably apply to without specialized skills and training i dont feel entitled to a job and dont think my college degree makes getting one automatic but maybe yall could help me get think of something a bit nicer than  store clerk i come from a snooty uppercrust background so i dont know the world of blue collar jobs as far as my passions and interests  ha ive been burned too many times to imagine myself having a job that is not only fair and honest but for which i have a passion im okay working at a place without a passion for it as long as it helps me pay my bills i would prefer structure and clear objectives so ill politely pass on how easy it is to do seo from home in the long run i would like to get back into higherpaying more meaningful work but i need something now id appreciate any ideas thanks ,3.0

48942,idk what to do i was diagnosed with depression about  years ago but nothing was ever done about it because my parents dont believe depression is a real thing ive been trying to deal with it on my own but sometimes it just gets to be too much for me ive tried to get my parents to understand but i just get shut down each time i usually spoke to extended relatives but due to family drama i no longer have anyone to talk to i go to a college i hate and where i have no friends so i spend the majority of my time alone in my door room ive tried seeing a counselor at my school on a weekly basis but ive convinced myself i am just being over dramatic i really just dont know what to do with myself,3.0

48944,can feel a depressive episode coming i met someone new recently and i havent really talked to them that much and they live really really far away but i feel myself falling for this person and i really dont want to and i feel like that triggered a depressive episode its hard to explain its like this sinking feeling in my gut and just feeling sad you know that feeling you get when you kinda start to realize youre into someone and you find yourself thinking about them a lot and your heart skips a beat when their name pops up on your phone i have that feeling and i havent felt that in a long time and i love it and hate it and its killing me because i cant be with this person its totally unrealistic and i barley even know her ive never even met them in real life but i have that feeling whats getting me is ive been doing so good ive had a really shitty time when it comes to relationships and just recently been feeling better about myself but now i feel terrible i feel like im not meant to be happy i have absolutely no business falling for this person who lives a state away someone i barley know have only talked to a handful of times i guess its because i like chasing this feeling but i know that its ridiculous and that makes me sad because itll just lead me no where and im chasing something thats completely made up in my head then its the thoughts of even if she was closer she would never want me like that and just keep telling myself that im not good enough its a really wtf situation for me i dont know if its because i like the attention or if its just been way too long since ive been with anyone but fuck why am i like this not to mention that as a guy these feelings make me feel emasculated its like i just want to lay in bed and feel sorry for myself and overthink and drown in my thoughts i hate that i associate being depressed with falling for someone i do this to myself i just wish i didnt care about any of that i wish i was content with being alone and i wish i could just be happy i know i sound stupid and probably dont make sense but ive just been feeling all these emotions and i just wanted to write out how im feeling even though im terrible with explaining how im feeling i dont knowif you read all of this know that i appreciate you and hope you get to be with the person you want to be with,3.0

48985,i have no idea what to do i am no one its been nearly a decade since i was diagnosed with quite possibly worst mental illness a person could contract in their life what the name of it is is not important what is important that for almost  years now ive been obeying voices in my head and trying to appease them to make them go away when i was  i was at first diagnosed with ocd after a short while my mother noticed that some of my ticks and symptoms didnt seem normal for a child with ocd i was later diagnosed with tourettes but again the symptoms didnt match finally after visiting a specialist i was diagnosed with a widely unknown and extremely rare mental illness that has affected my life ever since over the years the voices would tell me to do different things and give me various rules to follow that were similar to ocd however they constantly have changed and now its at a point where i just cant get a moment of relief unless im completely asleep my dreams are my only safe haven it doesnt seem like a day goes by where i dont think about just ending it but i refuse to because of how caring my mother has been to me throughout my life in all honesty if i didnt have her i would probably just end it ive been trying various medications for years but they never go away there was only one instance when i was  that i was put on celexa and all my symptoms went away and for the first time in years i truly felt the bliss of being a normal human being this was to be short lived as soon after the voices commanded me to abide by new rules that hadnt existed before then and i was back to where i was despite being hard to fit in and function at school peers i managed and hung out with a relatively popular friend group during the rest of my high school career hanging out with my friends on weekends and over the summer gave me a pseudo feeling of bliss not like i had before but it took my mind off the voices however high school is long gone and all my friends are at college i tried to commuting to a local university but found it hard to focus in class thats something i forgot to mention i used to excel in academics up until fifth grade when my illness completely took over i managed to bullshit my way through graduating high school because believe it or not all it really takes to graduate is to show up and give like  effort so here i am now alone in the dark and i have no idea what to do it feels like everyday i become less and less human i would give anything just for one day of being normal i have friends and have had several girlfriends but with them all gone and me still here im alone with just my thoughts and the voices its overwhelming has anyone had a similar experience that has a solution i know i can feel bliss again like i did the short couple of days when i was  i just need an answer,3.0

49315,good riddance to  and hello   had lots of down and low moments and one point i felt hang on why do i keep doing this to myself i know i have depression and we have tendency to self isolate ourselves but i couldnt face going back to that damned place again and i was after losing my last place at the uni did i really evaluate my life so i ditched that horrible toxic group in a real world that was making me feel absolutely shitty the superficial conversations and completely bunked turning up to jims cafe i didnt feel like a huge loss at hurt me it felt like a relief and one less problem to deal with i had a lovely couple of months being indoors which suited my own personality and what i wanted in life got back into music writing and soon began see a positivesi then started making goals for myself my first goals were to get up every morning so i did i then i quit sugar and that made things easier and began exercising  then i started thinking what i wanted to do so so i applied for my degree in social work and within weeks in i was actually a student and doing something meaningful and productive againmy ups didnt last long as student fiancé had messed up my passport and literally a few days before the end of the term gather a years a terms and this time i wasnt that backing down leave part way through the year self resilience and determination got me through that bump and thankfully the fees were sorted student finance admitted their mistakes i can finally see things getting slightly betterthen on the  december i got the call that my uncle lost his short battle with cancer and ended up having a very scaled down christmas didnt feel like putting on xmas films as i was upset and in shock to this im still in this numb place and then add extra pressure i didnt pass my first exam and that really pushed things right into the dark place i was already upset that my uncle had passed away at  and this really pushed my back into self destructive ways  new years eve came and i has lovely night with family and my journey continuesbut onwards and upwards things i am glad about no more meaningless groups ruining my mh starting my degree in social work my ten year battle of getting in professional course was over no more messing around saying  i dont have gcses  the wouldnt take me seriously why cant i just sign jobseekers i have put myself through a lot and my parentsnow im on big battle and this time i am gonna get there no one is gonna stop me,3.0

49528,i feel empty and alone i dont know if this is the right feed to post but it was the one that seemed most appropriatei was first diagnosed with anxiety disorder at the young age of  years old however it remained under the radar until this year as i finally graduated high school and moved onto university along with this my best friend left at the same time for his  year mission with the lds church all of this change left me confused and scared but with the help of therapy i was able to relieve my panic attacks quicklyits been  months since my last panic attack but ive rather been feeling lonely rather than worried i am surrounded by a ton of supportive friends but i would rather not tell any of them how im feeling i feel lonely and feel the need for human connection yet i isolate myself from the world at the same time  i will be surrounded in a room by hundreds of people but i just plug in my headphones to tune out the world theres moments where i feel a certain high from life and i wish i could hold onto it but often times that high will disappear i sit in my dark room crying and hidden from the world i am not suicidal but sometimes i wish i didnt exist i do feel happiness but often times i feel alone and lost for the past month as ive been driving the thoughts of just driving off a bridge or into a lamp post have rushed though my head and it scares me that i would even consider that theres days where i love life and others where i wish i didnt have onelately i have been convincing myself to see a doctor to find out if what ive been feeling could be related to depression or not i have had these feelings for close to  years now but they have only gotten worse as ive grown older whats been holding me back from talking to a doctor about this is the male stereotype ive been taught in a sense from a young age as a competitive athlete in my household ive often been taught that men dont show these dark emotions and that i should be mentally tougher so i jammed all of those emotions down inside me for years and years until i couldnt anymore i have quit drink alcohol as i was using it as a place to escape reality and ive replaced it with weightlifting as it keeps my mind distracted and happy i have lost motivation to work and i even took the semester off of university to relieve stress but now i sit around all day alone with my own thoughtsi feel scared alone and im unsure what to donone of my friends or family knows how i feel and im scared that people may resent me for how i amif there is any advice at all someone could give me it would be very helpfulsorry for the long rant but i have had this on my chest for months now,3.0

49578,my journey ah man i always swore to myself id never do one of these but fuck it and sorry for the heaviness i remember crying for nothing when i was really young a lot and having really bad mood swings when i was a teenager and throwing things off my bedroom walls for no apparent reason smashing up cds and the such no rhyme or reasonjust teenage hormonesas i got older the feelings didnt go away though and they kept appearing in different forms the most popular being utter self loathing and hatred feeling inadequate as a person this ultimately lead to dropping out of college dropping out of one of the uks best drama schools randomly quitting jobs  self harming and some rather weak attempts at the old taking your own life luckily im a big old pussycat the thought of what i put my family and friends through still makes me feel ill with regret and shame thankfully i have gotten a hold of that physical aspect through medication many wonderful health professionals and family and friends but unfortunately the mental aspect still berates me from time to timelike a large percentage of the population  i struggle with depression some days im fabulous and others im not so fabulous some days most infact im on top of the world motivated  confident happy but then comes along this big black train that steamrolls right into your life and cripples you when this happens it is game over i hate everyone and everything im angry and pissed off at everything but at none more so than myself  i spend a lot of time trying to make people laugh because laughing is important in this life i think seeing people laugh makes me feel worth while it makes me feel liked but when this train comes along the laughter fucks off and life without laughter isnt a life i want to be a part of losing the ability to care about anything is pretty much what happens i dont care about the things that mean everything to me on any regular day a feeling of frustration builds up inside to the point that i want to scream and punch a wall or myself i want to burst out crying and hurt the people i love most i want the world to just fuck off i want there to be nothingand thats not me i dont think thats who i amanywaythe train has been making regular stops recently and its been fucking garbage but i also know why i havent been particularly well for the last few months to the point i havent been able to eat for weeks at a time the plus side being im seeing numbers on the scales i havent seen for a long timesilver linings i havent been able to study for a life changing exam due to not being able to focus or get out of bed anxiety creeped in no sleep stress fear resentment and now depression as ive gotten older ive started to try and examine and identify the possible reasons or triggers and boy those fuckers are varied songs smells places people anything can be a trigger and when the trigger is pulled its difficult to get back normalitydepression is a wee arsehole right and it comes in many shapes and sizes its ok to be depressed or anxious or stressed like its really really really ok to be like that its ok to feel worthless and pathetic theres nothing wrong with feeling like you want to just disappear for a while or to stop talking or stop laughing whats not ok is believing that you are on your own because you are not the one thing i have learnt from my journey on this train and its been a tough lesson to learn taught to me by my wife and my family is that you are not alone this world is a shitty shitty place at times but if we all try and stick together we might just be ok no matter how much you dont want it think it or believe it we are good for one another im trying to not give a fuck anymore to not give a fuck about the things that mean fuck all im trying to not give a fuck about depression about being liked or being succesfull and thats why im posting this i dont want to care if you think this cringey or attention seeking if i wanted attention id get on stage or post one of my hilarious instagram stories what i do give a fuck about is people not knowing that its ok to feel like this or that its not normalit is normal really fucking normal i give a fuck that my family and friends and strangers know that depression like a cold comes along out the blue and can affect anyone the most likely or unlikely people that yeah it is normal and it is ok to feel like a fucking emotional wreck and a failure  so lets all cut the bullshit and stop pretending to be people that we are not and be the people we are everybody wears a mask in life but its ok to take that mask off be vulnerable to not be ok and for you to do what you need to do you arent a burden and you arent a weight youre a gift and you are special and we are lucky to have one another ,3.0

49583,what is the best way to helpsupport boyfriend with persistent depressive disorder already posted on depression help hoping this reaches more people throwaway account it started years ago when my  boyfriend  mentioned to me that hes never actually happy he will laugh and have fun but hes never actually happy since then ive encouraged him to go to a doctor he decided to see one and was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and sleep deprivation however he never went back to get medication nor did he seek therapy or receive any kind of professional help it constantly affects our relationship and so i asked him to get therapy after much delay he decided to go and from an outsiders perspective it seems as though the therapy was slowly starting to help him manage his depression since the coronavirus pandemic sent us home from college hes been getting worse not showing up to online classes and missing assignments hes also been distant and i have no idea what hes thinking or doing i just want to make sure hes okay but dont know how to help since we cant see each other we recently got into an argument because his depression has made it hard for me because it feels like ive been carrying the relationship for a long time i have never had depression before so i have no idea what the experience is like all i can do is sympathize and try to understand as much as i can from an outside perspective and this isnt about me but his depression has deeply affected our relationship i wanted to break things off but immediately regretted saying that i think that really hurt him and he hasnt spoken to me in over a week but said he will reach out when hes thought about things more i dont know what to do i want to help him and our relationship i want to be there for him do i reach out when should i reach out would trying to talk to him when he isnt ready going to make things worse he says that he did see a future with me but now things are foggy im not quite sure if this is linked to depression maybe some of you guys can help elucidate this situation for me i want to ask those of you who know what its like to experience depression about what helps you the most i care so much about him and i just want to do whats best for him his mental health and our relationship,3.0

49789,i  just needed to put my thoughts into the world for someone to hear i dont know how to start this shit its midnight and tomorrow i have an interview thatll be dependant on whether or not i get into university i need to fucking sleep but my mind is racing and i feel the lowest i have in a while im feeling the need to get this mental weight off my shouldersi feel like a fucking let down to my entire family i have  sisters and they have all settled down been to university and landed a somewhat successful career path for themselves i went to university once  years ago and i left midterm whilst living at student accommodation i didnt leave my room for weeks at a time and i barely ate  and no one even knew or cared im horrific at writing and my brain is all over the place so none of this is going to be in order or even make sensei currently live on my own and its so lonely again i spend weeks just in my room and barely eating i play video games all day as its the closest thing i have to human connection and i truly believe my bestest friends are online but thats the kicker of this shit i need a real human connection with someone i want a physical connection its so painful to admit that im so fucking lonely and sad all the time that i cant say it to anyonei recently admitted to myself my mum and a few friends that i have that i am depressed one of my friends that we will call ben will text me every now and then and check that im okay and i really love it when he does it touches my fucking heart but i never see him and we talk so infrequently my other friend that we will call chloe knows the most about my mental state and knows the most about me in general she had been my best friend for going on  years at this point i love her more than life and i would do anything for her to make her smile but she wouldnt do the same for me i need her right now she isnt here i try calling her she never answers or returns my calls despite her knowing of my situation it makes me hate her it makes me want to die so then maybe she will realise how much i needed her i would never though because i would feel evil i stopped trying to contact her and what do you know we havent spoken since i have no real friends that are actually here i just want a hugim lusting for a relationship probably out of my loneliness i just want to love someone with my entire heart i want to put all my energy into making someone feel special and wanted i now want to move on to things ive never had the courage to tell anyone about mainly regarding my ex boyfriend i was raped i was abused when i was raped i was laying in his bed annoyed with him and just about to go to sleep i was unresponsive to anything he did to me i felt him touching me and then he started having sex with me whilst i was laying as still as anything with my arms crossed and i didnt know what to fucking do so i just laid there helplessly i was  or  at the time the times he abused me i honestly cant remember specific details of it all because its all a blur in my mind but i remember some of the things he did i was head butted kicked punched and bitten i remember one time i had a few really bad bite marks on my arm and my sister asked what it was and i had to tell her it was from some guy that bit me when we were playing tag rugby in pe she probably knew that was complete bullshit i might empty some more of my mind on to here at another time i just needed to get some of this shit out and thank you for reading this and caring i hope you have a great day,3.0
49790,spent  months waiting on ect and now stuck waiting more months i was finally referred for ect by my psychiatrist after losing my job and having a bunch of suicidal thoughts i was referred in september and i finally got my first appointment with one of the only doctors in the city able to do ect during my appointment he told me that theyre backed up due to the record demand of patients needing ect it will probably be another month or two before i can get ect sessions started he recommended that i go into a partial hospitalization program in the mean time since im unemployed and not doing anything what a total waste of timeive been unemployed since august and have been unable to find decent work since im running out of options with finding something to give me actual results in improving my depression ive already done php a couple years ago after being hospitalized for suicidal thoughts it was a complete waste of time for me trying to do it again doesnt sound like itll do me any good my mom thinks itll help me but she mostly just wants me to have something to do while my husband is at work what will it take for people to get that im sick of being like this and im running out of options trying to recommend shit ive already tried is not going to help at all,3.0

49795,human existence  suffering i suppose this is really a bit of therapy for me i have for almost  years now dealt with my mental health issues alone i have no problem dealing with these things but at times it is nice to know i am not alone in the world my story is nothing too crazy i do not come from a battered or broken home i had a pleasant childhood with the privilege of being surrounded by family and friends sure things were not perfect but then again who had a perfect childhood in a sense i used to feel guilt about my depression namely due to the fact i did not have some crazy trauma or patterns of unspeakable events that fucked me up in other words i didnt have some story of heartbreak and pain i just had a normal life filled with opportunity and support yet i still felt alone and empty inside from an early age as i grew older i became more aware and in touch with my feelings this helped tremendously if for no other reason than i now had an answer or label for what was happening in my brainlet me provide some context for what i believe were a series of life events that ultimately led me down this path i am currently traveling onlife is pretty good minus the occasional self esteem issues that an teenager deals with as i move into my college years life really starts to happen no longer am i sheltered by the strict boundaries my parents used to govern me now i am free in the world no longer able to hide behind the facade within a matter of  months the following events happened first real relationship was over granted high school love is subjective my parents who were married for  years decided they did not love each other any longer and so got divorced  my grandfather passed away i was raised in a christian home and was spoon fed this extremely toxic poison my entire life i had finally gained the courage and knowledge needed to leave that part of my life behind and transition to the non religious lifestyle very liberating but due to the years of brainwashing felt enormous guilt associated with this decision i think religious guilt is something that does not get talked about enough and can definitely account for a portion of my unhappiness and certain cynicism to the world especially organized religion  furthermore as my generation moves away from the shackles of organized religion as a whole this topic will become much more prominent in the years to come i have much more to say on this but will save for the appropriate forum the best for last i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis asthis was undoubtedly the icing on the cake for me and frankly was the breaking pointin short as has a number of effects on the bodymind notably to the body the joints in your neck back hips coccyx and sacrum are all inflamed thus pain ensues in addition the spine begins to fuse together creating what is called bamboo spine this process takes some time and fortunately i have been able to slow the progression of this with modern medicine so every day is a painful day to some extent and at some location in the body pain is what allowed me to discover this disease after several years of being misdiagnosed simply due to ignorance and lack of education on as in the medical community the worst thing about as other than the life sentence of chronic pain would be the effects it has on me mentally the worst of them are depression and fatigue i would rather deal with days of pain at level  than days of fatigue and depression at half that fatigue is the desire and overwhelming need to literally do nothing you have no energy for one there is a lack of motivation for two the pain is the nail in the coffin when it comes to trying to overcome fatigue now take fatigue the feeling like you have been hit by a truck dragged down the road and left for dead and add depression to it this is a lethal cocktail that can overtake and control your life if allowed i have learned that while i cannot beat these forces being aware and maintaining a firm grip on reality helps me survive these episodic nightmaresthis is not an as forum and so for sake of boring you to death with as and its black clouds of side effects i will circle back to the main topic of this postas i type this out i feel simultaneous relief and uncertainty about what i have said i have always struggled with taking a plethora of thoughts and articulating them in a manner that is informative and succinct i would like to say in closing i know that what i have been through or experienced pales in comparison to some of you who have had to overcome extreme hardships and adversities in life everyone has their battles they are fighting daily some do well in the wake of the battles while others succumb to the unfathomable reality their life has become while i have never been suicidal or wanted to die mainly because i have lost several friends even a boss to suicide and have seen the effects it has on the ones left behind i can appreciate and understand the misery and pain that drives one to this unfortunate demise in this life the only certainty other than death is the notion that humans are designed to suffer as long as we can become in tune with the fact the world is increasingly ambiguous and owes us nothing i think we can get on the right path as a society hope i havent bored you to tears

49864,a new low today i screwed up the interview for my dream job id already been having a tough few months so this on top just comes as a real punch in the gut i know its impossible to objectively judge your own interview performance but the job im going for has fairly rigid scoring criteria which are shared with candidates in advance within these are certain red flags whereby if the candidate does certain things or fails to do something that should be done they are deemed unappointable i dont want to go into too much detail to avoid identifying myself and because the recruitment process is still ongoing but the job im going for is within healthcare and in the clinical part of the interview i was faced with a scenario that although straightforward was different to what i was expecting and so threw me because i couldnt apply my normal approach to handling a situation like that i forgot the most basic of things most notably calling for senior help in fact at one point i think i even inexplicably said that i didnt want to call at that point not escalating appropriately is one of the biggest red flags in the scoring criteria now the frustrating thing is that in real life id be able to handle the situation given without any problem which would include ensuring i had appropriate help in fact i was in a similar situation only a week ago and actually handled it pretty well all this wouldnt be so bad if i could just reapply and try again shortly but recruitment is a national yearly process what this means is that im going to have to start hunting for a job to fill the next year and although im sure whatever i end up doing will provide good experience im not sure how im going to find the motivation knowing that i messed up my chance at the one i really wantedthere are several other things going on at the moment from recent deaths of colleagues to the fact that ill shortly be moving to back to a job i strongly dislike prior to my contract ending and me needing to find something new in general im just really struggling with lack of motivation to do anything all i do is work and come home and browse reddityoutube i also cant stop comfort eating and so have gained a lot of weight recently which is only making me feel worse about myself im not really sure what im expecting from posting here but i suppose i just needed to vent about how utterly hopeless i feel at the moment,3.0

49869,do you think you can actually change your outlook on what life is about do you think you can actually change your outlook on what life is aboutmaybe outlook is the wrong word but more so  life philisophy or  change the way you look at the world and how to achieve happiness maybe i am not being specific enough but after suffering  years of a sharp decline in my lifestyle on a relative basis i find myself with no jobcareer prospects no friends in debt and putting on weight i dont want to sound hyperbolic in any way but truly am lost spending most days wondering around on my own literally walking in circles or sitting on benches feeling uncontrollably confused and frustrated i think we all have a view or expectation of what life shouldcan be for oursleves when we are growing up and how to achieve that its of course different for everyone but i what i want to know is do people think its possible to change your mindset or formula for what happiness looks like to me it is quite shallow in some ways and i guess phantasmagoric a good career that you are intellectual curious in that pays relatively well and that society values in terms of statusthats my shallowness coming out when i say pays well i dont desire ridiculous amounts but enough to live in a big city and not have to worry about paying for a concert ticket on the weekend and be generous enough to help your friendsfamily when they need you a partner or girlfriend who you are genuinely attracted to and like and havent just settled due to internal securities about getting older and  loneliness a group of friends that you feel comfortable being totally honest with and actually often do things with a feeling of not necessarily being confident in yourself but at least a calmness with who you are instead of constantly questioning your personality and eroding characterat this point of time i havent got or achieved any of these things not even close and more importantly feel i have lost all capabilitybelief on at least getting on a path build towards these dreams as obviously these things dont happen overnight i feel i have missed the boat for that sort of life as everyone who i know although may not be living dream lifestyles certainly are in jobscareerslife paths that are more orthodox what i want to know is considering these themes have been in my head since a young child in one form or another do people think its possible to let them all go to erase them from my philosophical framework on what life is about in essence reconfiguring my happiness formula to be something else for example try live a life where money doesnt matter at all or career doesnt matter but getting by doing something i dont necessarily like but pays the bills not worry so much about womencourtship and dating but just be happy being on my own not fixating on my weight which i guess is not that bad anyway but be grateful for my health in general and access to a plate of food forget about materialistic or shallow things like the way i look or what i have or what people think of me and build a life on something completely different all of this has been playing in my mind a lot over the past  months i have been unemployed for  and half years and really have given up on life the only thing i am holding on to is the hope that changing my formula for happiness might work however i cant get all the feelings of failure out of my head constantly even if i laugh at something for a brief second strangely i am reminded how badly i have fucked up every opportunity i have been handed due to my inability to actually do anything of substance in my life again the word substance is subjective and is related to this image of what i think life should be like if i could change it it would help ive rambled again but was very grateful for the responses to my last post,3.0

49873,currently having a mental breakdown and just need to vent and talk to somebody this is gonna sound like a pathetic pity party but fuck it    okay so ive been sitting here for the past half hour uncontrollably crying my eyes out while my essay thats due tomorrow is nowhere near being done originally it felt like this essay among several other bullshit assignments due this week was the reason for me feeling so shitty but as i sit here and think i realize the root of my unhappiness is so much deeper than that      basically i just hate school i cant fucking stand it ever since kindergarten its been a nightmare to get out of bed everyday to go now that im in university nothing has changed in fact its only gotten worse im only here because of stupid societal pressures that basically tell you theres no other ways to succeed in life which my parents have unfortunately bought into       at  i was forced to decide what i wanted to do with my life and even then i had no idea so i was kinda like uhhh i guess psychology sounds kinda interesting so i guess ill do that well now im less than halfway to completing my degree and i cant even take it anymore it feels like everything im doing is pointless im probably not going to even be able to find a job when i graduate and if i do theres no guarantees im going to be happy       im wasting my parents thousands of dollars and i feel so guilty about it but whenever i complain about anything school related they wont have it      im also kind of kicking myself in the foot because i used to figure skate and i could have easily stayed in it and gotten a job with disney on ice or something like that which i would absolutely love and would make me happy but stupid me decided to quit when i was  because i didnt want to compete in competitions anymore i could still go back but it would be pointless if i couldnt find a job with it and i fear that since its been over two years and im completely out of shape that its too late      i hate life but at least getting all that off my chest kinda made me feel better i guess,3.0
49874,coronavirus ruined all the progress i was making with my depression i struggled with depression all of high school only had a few friends mostly coasted through my classes but did well enough to get into the college i wanted to i was so excited finally i could get away from my family and be around people i enjoyed being around i could do things i wanted to with my own time and feel in control of my life for oncethats exactly what happened when i started college this year it wasnt all easy but i managed to find good friends get involved socially and i enjoyed most of my classes for the first time in years my depression seemed to be getting better i had people and things to live for and an existence that wasnt entirely awful all the timenow this fucking virus made me leave my friends and go back to being around my family who were the ones that drive me insane in the first place yes i can still contact them but its not the same im not able to see them nearly as often and there was something about face to face contact that truly made me feel better now all of that is gone not to mention that online classes have completely ruined my routine and killed any motivation i had to succeed i got used to feeling hopeless and that there wasnt light at the end of tunnel and right when i managed to find that light the world came and kicked me right in the ass again i finally had hope and now im stuck in the same hopeless void again except now theres also a fucking plague that threatens people i care aboutfuck this fuck this existence once you think you have your shit together life gives you a swift kick in the ass once again,3.0

50027,i told me boyfriend  that i feel like i  want to die and he brushed me off multiple times i dont know what to do or how to feel about it advice wanted ive been trying for months to choke up the courage to tell someone that sometimes i feel suicidal ive wanted to tell my boyfriend first because he is around me most when im having bad days but when i have really bad days and have these feelings i shut down and i dont talk or text him as much this is out of character for me so when this happens my bf just assumes im mad about something avoids the topic and leaves me to be mad or cool down when i finally start to feel better i confronted him about this on multiple different occasion because this has happened more than once  he admits he knows im upset but doesnt wanna argue so he just ignores that i am upset and carries on with normal topics at this point in each convo i decide that he doesnt deserve to know or isnt the right person to go totonight after he had ignored that im upset all day and i  confronted him again that i had a bad day he said that it was obvious today i just said it after he said that he knew i was upset because my car broke down i said i wanted to die all day and ive tried so many times to tell u these past months when i feel like this but you always ignore me when i withdraw and you never listened to me enoigh to deserve to know this is what he said back im not ignoring you on purpose thats iti said it again an hour later that i wanted to die today and he said you just said u felt lonely and i tried talking about it when i say i want to die he just defends his side of the conversation is it wrong that i expected some concern or wanting to help or wanting to understand why i feel that how i feel etci dont know if he just doesnt understand or how i should approach thisi feel very violated and dismissedam i wrong in how i feel about all this does anyone have any advice,3.0

50335,a rough patch there are a lot of things im feeling right now and have nowhere to turn im not usually the type of person who vents to strangers or feel trapped within my emotions but i dont have a source of emotional support at the moment and im not exaggerating when i say this is one of the most traumatic and hardest periods in my life in fact id mark it as the first time ive felt completely out of control and distraught to the point ive thought about self harming again like i used to im struggling with coming out of a two year long abusive relationship im  years old going on  in a few weeks ive been in this situation since high school and have made multiple attempts to break free of this relationship friends even tried to interfere once even going as far as having an intervention for me with our high school counselor i always felt i wasnt strong enough to leave even after very extreme attempts at breaking it off we always somehow ended up back together again sometimes id even go as far as telling other people and he would threaten me and tell me to cut off the people id vent to this kind of insane behavior was what had taken place the first half of our relationship ill spare the details for my own sake but it was pretty ugly it felt like after a year or so he had me wrapped around his finger completely i even started to feel intense sympathy for him a little background he had a lot of stories and trauma from his childhood and mental health issues that i really doubted and still doubt a lot of to this day and he would often use this as an excuse for his actions i think i was even coming to need him depend on him i loved him and cared for him this much was appertent even from the starti went off to college and we didnt talk as much didnt see each other as much we were really falling out and i was getting stronger and more mature by being on my own i went to stay with him at his place and celebrate christmas with him and his family they bought me a lot of stuff and i think we had a decent time together clearly breaking up was something id always wanted to do i became more reluctant the second year of our dating and pushed it off but became sure i was prepared for the break up before  i thought  could be a year of something new i even had someone i really liked supporting me through it all and we are now developing a relationship i dumped him before  cold turkey before getting to spend some time with the person mentioned before i thought dumping him while with someone i felt safe with would help but now that the person is gone im at a loss i feel completely alone and even went to check my exes social mediaim having insane thoughts about being without him hes doing really well and it brought me to tears because im so proud of him and genuinely happy because he probably needed the break up too to help him grow as a person but i still felt sad im sad that im alone most of my friends having gave up on me because of this relationship long ago and the one person who is supporting me works often i feel scared and like i ruined something perfect even though i know thats not the case and just his words in my head still i dont know what to do i think im losing my mind,3.0

50557,been giving in a lot more lately ive been pretty ok with my life of course not really but recently ive had more and more thoughts of suicide and running away leaving everything even the single most precious person i love or at least think i lovein a recent little argument we had she called me out on doing bad habits and that i do things she told me she doesnt like she said shes tired of me constantly making the same mistakes i tried explaining to her that my head is too clouded to remember things that are important to me and she should understand because she suffers from depression aswell and has forgotten our anniversary several times but i never got mad or annoyed at her for that but when i said i dont want to live anymore and that she should leave me before she gets more depressed over my death she said she thinks im making my depression up as an excuse to emotionally abuse and manipulate herive gone too deep in this relationship to breakup with her i feel forced to stay or else shell do something but i agreed that we can 𝘵𝘳𝘺 a poly relationship with someone she fell for in the mental hospital so now knowing she has someone to be happy with and she seems way happier with him than me most the time i feel like i have no worries to cut the ties with everyone i know,3.0

50580,anyone else hoping to die from coronavirus ive been praying to be taken out of this life for years now when i first saw this story i actually had excitement in me and followed it every single day since it first was reported in january not that i was happy other people were dying but that there was finally something that might take me outim  and have always been healthy with no underlying health issues i did smoke between  years old and then have gone off and on the past  years so my lungs must have some damage from smoking the nicotine does help me cope with my low energydepression better i did start again a couple weeks ago i figure maybe theres a shot it will actually kill me even though a lot of young people recover but when i heard there are some who recover but are left with permanent lung damage that has worried me if i were to survive but then had to deal with scarred lungs that would make life even worse im so utterly desperate to be done with this life which is one reason i started smoking again to weaken my lungs and make it easier for the virus to kill me but now im conflicted on continuing to smoke or notim sure everyone will tell me i should quit and i understand why but like i said it does actually help me feel better with the nicotine i dunnoi dont know what to think or do anymore i really have no desire whatsoever to continue living i want it to kill me but im also scared of surviving with complications so i dont know what to do about the smokingany input would be greatly appreciated thanks,3.0
50581,my experience on planet earth i am about  sure i am depressed and that number comes from my extensive online research spanning over  years heres a disclaimer so you dont feel totally scammed if you are that kind of person but i havent been professionally screenedso heres my vent for you during which ill e chilling listening to music and drinking pepsi not that it is relevanti was born a little over  years ago as a male in a country that is one of the best countries in the world and i am not being patriotic at all its a fact i was totally average at everything that mattered our grade schools and secondary schools use  grading system and i was a student of  in grade school which is grades  starting the year you turn  secondary school is continuation from  grade and spans over  years i just checked and apparently they are treated as one primary school but i lived treating them as minor and major grades so thats how i present them to youso in grade school  grades i first came in touch with the bad vibes you all know and love depression or at least i think i did anyway it was in grade number  when i first started thinking about funny ways to kill myself i actually thought i had become insanei had heard of the emo culture and like a normal unstable person i trigger warning went into my wrist with a pencil sharpeners blade i did so again with a real knife nothing too deep but i still have visible scars and i used to hate myself for being so stupid as to selfharm myself but nowadays i dont care i also had anemia that i got for not providing my body with sufficient amounts of foodi spent my days playing video games now i recognize that as escapism but ill add to that later on such as black ops  on my  and thinking how shit life is i did not and do not have any problems in life like bullying or something like that even though i used to be a pussy in fact i had great friends and a great childhood my emotions started going away this year too and i begun to feel depressedin the seventh grade first year of secondary school i made new friends and learned new things about humans as social animals my me image started to form i no longer felt like i had lost my mind and i got rid of anemia i lived for school and video games i did not have any goals or dreams in life and i have never had any to this day well thats a lie because when i was a small child so small i dont remember i wanted to be a helicopter pilotso in that grade i had a personality and life defining experience i did an oopsie and stole a phone i got caught and alls well the criminal was apprehended from it i learned that life is what you make of it and i began to see the real world and how nothing really matters and we are living in this strange state of volatile harmony people appointed presidents are just people to whom we assign some sort of mental importancy shits fucked grade comes and i start doing normal teen stuff like smoking cigs i never thought i was cool while doing it and i never did it to fit in it was just fun sucking on that bastard i did not want to get addicted so i made sure to not do it too much during this grade my sexual revolution started grade i spent doing under average in school and begun occassionally drinking alcohol i made kilju sugar wine made with yeast sugar and water about  if you do it right and got someone to get me real beer i also tried the green stuffnone of this secondary school information really matters because i was just there then not really feeling anything the only moments of real happiness were the ones spent drunk its like every time i drink my emotions flood outi finally got out of primary school and went to vocational school i did really bad so i was lucky to get into the school i wanted otherwise i would have had to gone to  grade during which you ramp up your grades to get into the school you wantso starting clean i went to vocational school and my first year went okay nothing sepcial felt more depressed and existential than ever before though i also learned i was gay there ends my sexual revolution i had no problems coming to terms with it at all i spent the year thinking casually about suicide and how easy itd be no real intentions mind you i also became toxic i dont like peoplenow the easiest part of my earth experience to tell the present the second year of vocational school i am not good at remembering stuff because it doesnt really matter anymore now is not then i feel pretty okay overall but i lack motivation and get anxious easily for years i have had this dark background in my mind it is hard to explain but it is usually referred to as mist my thought are jumbled up and my attention span is pretty bad i can read a book but if i listen to music or if theres any background vocals i slow down to snail speeds its easier for me to type a text like this though because it is of my own creation i dont need to tap into someone elses thoughtsi see nothing for me in the future i lost interest in this career i chose to learn in vocational school and i also lost my interest in gaming i do like playing with others but its always this or that game my best friend doesnt play more than a few games and it is hard for me to convince him to play something else on the other hand i dont really like playing with others either because it takes energy to talk and interact i love owning games but not playing them i want to play games though but i lose it the moment i open steam gog or whateveri am not one to skip school but some mornings are just too hard i cant bring myself to brush my teeth and i just sleep a few more hours and then decide to not go at alli just wish i could sleep forever and not know i am sleeping because that breaks the story unfolding my current escapism is my anime watching habit that started in  grade but became an escapistic behaviour later on living is just boring to me and sometimes it is so boring my brain feels like rubber that is a strange way to put it but there are no human words to describe the feeling my worst enemy is boredom and i am always feeling bored i dont feel casually suicidal anymore thoughthe thing i am most anticipating right now is my birthday so i can purchase beer and other alcoholic beverages under certain percentage at  you can buy vodka and all that luxury stuffmy thought are not flowing very well right now so i think ill leave this here with a tldrtldr been feeling shit and hollow for years and cant see anything interesting in my future feel extremely bored and get anxious easily best thing is sleeping but its too shortlived experience all in all i feel like i am living in a moment long gone i am a shell  i am also toxic see my comment history for retarded shit,3.0

50620,i look like i have my shit together i really dont its probably a usual post here facing similar issues as others and i do wish things get better for all of usmaybe a little different than some ill soon be graduating from university at  i had gooddecent grades a lot of research experience led oncampus clubs working on a small startup with a friend and am usually seen to be the social guy but beneath the shiny surface things suck my sleep and eating schedule is messed up my research paper is getting delayed and delayed because my supervisor takes forever to revise and always have new often unrealistic revision demands plus theres a competitor doing similar stuff thiss okay for grad school though someone wrote me a bad reference letter and got me rejected almost everywhere  i worked so hard since i got into college so that i can go to grad school and this dream seems to be shattered thanks to my bad choice of referee worse as ive been working in the lab too much my friend circle kept shrinking from the first year me who had fun with a bunch of friends weekly to now i can count the number of real friends still with me with one hand and i cant open up to all of them too and then theres the relationships ive not had a real relationship ive never properly dated anyone and ive tried few people who liked me i didnt like back and conversely people whom i liked never worked out i feel like an insecure loser and a fraud whos so inexperienced compared to my peers who are for sure older than me  but that doesnt ease my mindto add to it my best friend in college had a huge crush on me but i was so stupid and never recognized it cuz i thought ah were doing this cuz were good friends so what if shes the opposite gender i guess as she claimed we did in a way have a fake relationship but no romance involved and not physical either so at some point last year she decided shed confess to me that she loves me and i was shocked and i didnt say yes i thought wed never work out cuz we are so different and i didnt want to lose our friendship turnt out after she deleted me from her life and went on exchange i realized how big of a role she played in my life and i really really missed her  i stupidly dwelled on that emotion for three months and fell for her those few months sucked so bad after she came back i did everything to see if i could date her but she says shes gotten over me were just friends right now and its tormenting me  wed still talk but we are so far than how we were before and i want more she says shes not interested in a relationship and dont want to fall back so its a new cycle of suffering on top of the academic thingsive often been seen and introduced as this young and academically successful boy in a hardcore science major i agree im not dumb and can work hard but i also know i have a bunch of issues i guess i feel isolated and worthless i wasted my time doing things that dont make me happy i dont have much socialrelationship experience and i havent exactly been successful  academically now its been proven with grad school and socialwise i know it myself i feel increasingly lonely despite a decent group of acquaintances i could reach out to because i suppose they see me having some sort of value but they arent friends and most arent looking to be my friend i havent had a romantic experience with anyone and i question myself daily for my inability and whether i can ever find someone ill like and wholl like me too i have dreams for my career but i feel they are so far from being achieved and i absolutely despise the suffocating idea of a  job for  years until i retire i have great parents who live in a different continent and because theyre so proud of me i cant persuade myself to just give up i often ask myself can i ever find happiness an accompany and some degree of success life thats been going downhill and recently tried to repetitively remind me that dont be so optimistic i want to be able to do it but i just want to hide myself somewhere because i lost my confidence on everything i can feel myself slowly losing my shit and universitys counseling service is garbagehas  months waste i dont know i feel downthanks for reading this unstructured hope everything gets better for you,3.0

50774,just start by doing one thing a day depression is horrible draining exhausting allconsuming im living the experience and know all too well the best piece of advice i can impart is to just set the goal of doing one thing a day no need to set huge lavish goals just start off with one small task i highly recommend this goal to be brushing your teeth firstly it gets you out of bed even if its just for a brief second sometimes even just getting out of bed is enough of a change to bring about more energy and drive second it goes a long way to make you feel a little bit cleaner a little bit more human then if you feel a bit more like a person it could lead you to accomplish more tasks maybe a shower after showering nice and clean maybe youd feel like a walk who knows use it as a gateway lastly dental health is really important and can go downhill very fast which could then lead to exacerbating your depression ,3.0

50971,a little about me  just looking for thoughts hey there reddit i really didnt think i would be one of those people asking the internet for advice but after another drunken outing ending my relationship here i am again alone on a holiday waking up thankfully not too hungover waiting for my ex to come pick up her stuffits a long read but if you have the time id appreciate ithere are the details and as much as you need to stop drinking is the right advice im hoping people might be able to give a little more thankslast nighthanging out with the so trying to make plans for the holiday i work in retail so i rarely get two days off in a row we go out for a decent dinner at a brew pub and escape room which we beat then go to the bar downstairs shes tired and probably wants to go home but im buzzed and want more alcohol and the nba allstar game is on so thats a good excuse i get way to drunk admit to her i think about suicide sometimes and blame her for god knows what she ubers home alone as do i eventually and i dont say anything particularly nasty other than i want to break up mostly because im embarrassed about my behaviourworklife is alright in general im slowly digging my way out of debt got a promotion at work huge wholesale membership based retailer came with a big raise and even bigger in  months or so when i finish my training and officially get my own department im a smart guy but lazy when it comes to school i want to be a doctor and very well could but i cant get my shit together enough to study at least without losing motivation halfway through like most things in life sometimes i make silly mistakes at work because im on autopilot that could cost me my promotion if i dont get my shit together im fairly resentful about working in a grocery store still at  even though i get paid phenomenally well love the people i work with and the company treats me super welldrinkingi picked up most of my heavy drinking habits in the navy in university i often get blackout drunk and am either rude to people or tell lies i cant take back in the morning because im insecure about how little i am doing with my life or i want people to like me more the funny part is they already do people think im a smart successful wonderful guy i guess thats not entirely a lie i am smart i make good money if you count that as a measure of success and i genuinely care about the people around me and would do anything for anyone to make their lives better as long as im sober drinking  beers in a night sometimes alone in my room sometimes out with people who i then immediately cut out of my life out of embarrassment is par for the course with most of my interpersonal relationships drinking that much feels like my equivalent of restarting a laggy computer sure it still lags when it comes back on and you havent really dealt with the underlying issue but at least it can do its job againotherive spoken to a psychologist before but eventually lose interest i actually really looked forward to the sessions but once a week isnt enough to keep me going or committed to doing them i have two childhood friends who know most of this but dont live nearby and very few other real personal relationships in the new city i moved toin reality im not sure why i typed this all out but it was kind of cathartic to get it off my chest now i see why people suggest writing to clarify your thoughtsplease feel free to share ideas  suggestions  similar experiences especially if youve felt similar and manage to turn it aroundthanks,3.0

50990,what if you cant change it you know i spend sometimes my time reading here and on quora what people are going through and frequently i see someone hitting them with the you should change that or this try getting out more go the gym etc etc it leaves me wondering what if they just cant change it what happens when that girl speaking about how ugly she is is indeed horribly ugly and has no money to fix that what happens when someone feeling terribly lonely can do nothing about it because the why is near impossible to change like horrible social anxiety or something speaking about that i have someone in my class who talks to none and almost none talks to him i do talk to him not because he has things to say he says only yes no or answers directly your question  initiative otherwise but because i dont want him to feel lonely he rarely looks at you directly in the eyes it feels like he has been raised like that and wont change for at least some time he probably is doing efforts to change that but it scares me the idea he will stay like that forever  lonely i might be just assuming he might be happy more than me or anyone else but its frightening to imagine that hes suffering because of his personality because that means he has important problems very hard to change what about people who have low self esteem for whatever reason and that is impacting their lives theyre told to work on that but how hobbies and stuff okey but sometimes they do have hobbies they do enjoy themselves but it just doesnt work around othersare they doomed to live doubting themselves forever to not having a so just because they indeed act like theyre not good enough what about that woman with the very acute voice or that man who has acnea that just wont go away it does go away eventually but sometimes it takes a long time what about people born with serious diseases like a malformation or a deficiencysimply  what should happen when something is annoying the shit out of you is obviously impacting your moodhappinesswellbeing but you can do nothing about itsorry because this post doesnt concern me i guess this subreddit is made for people to talk about themselves but i have empathy for suffering people and i want to be able to answer i can do nothing about it when its true at least once in my life ,3.0

51042,how to help someone who is bipolar and suicidal i have a friend that is bipolar and has been posting some pretty dark things on her finsta fake instagram  basically an instagram for your close friends where you can feel free to post whatever you want  recently theyve turned suicidal and i cant help but think that theyre low key signs calls for help i want to help but i really dont know the best way to go about itthe other problem is we were friends in middle school but she moved away to a different school and since then we havent talked regularly ive probably only seen her twice in person in the last  years and only recently started talking to her again and when we do talk it doesnt often reach a deep enough level where shes opened up to me not that i expect her to at this point i just dont know if i should take that as a sign of her not wanting help from me or just shyness after having not talked at that level for a while nowi wouldnt consider her high risk for actual suicide right now or id get real help i just want to do something to let her know that people care about her and that shes not alone in her feelings she works at a fast food place close to me so i was thinking of maybe just leaving a note and some flowers idk by her car after work to surprise heri guess my main questions arewhat would you want in this scenariowhat would you suggest i doive dealt with people that were depressed but never someone who was bipolar do i help them in any different ways than someone who is depressedtldr i have a friend who is bipolar and has said some fairly dark things and i feel like theyre cries for help i want to do something to let her know that i care and that shes not alone as she hasnt been too open over text additionally we used to be good friends but we havent talked in three  years until about a week ago so i dont want to do anything that would come off as creepy or anything but i feel like this is too serious to just let it slide by see questions in above paragraphthanks a ton,3.0

51064,what the fuck is happening to me just now i found myself outside very cold night btw halfheartedly smoking a cigarette while listening to radiohead hood up head down letting my long stringy hair hang down just looking into the woods that picture right there is a perfect depiction of how i feel right nowi dont smoke because i know how addictive it can be and the kind of things it can do i usually try to keep my head at normal level because i know itll help my posture i keep my hair washed and out of my face because i know it looks good that waybut for some reason i just dont carei wish i knew why usually when i get depressed its because im really stressed out about something but i have nothing to be that stressed about right now im just depressed and not in a sense of deep palpable sadness id prefer that honestly hell it isnt even a sense of exhaustion id prefer that too at least im used to that and i know how to deal with itthe thing im feeling now is just a kind of emptiness its a sense of cynicism and nihilism and not the fun punkrock kind its the boring kind where you just say fuck it and lie around drinking and smoking because why the fuck not i just dont fucking care its not even that im tired of life or that i want to die i just dont give a fuck one way or another sure this cigarette will take  minutes off my life and sure it tastes awful and sure i dont even really like the buzz but i just dont care i remember thinking while smoking that cigarette stuff like i dont care if i puke and  less minutes i wont have to wasteall of a sudden i realised what i was doing and i immediately put out the cigarette threw it away along with the whole pack and brushed my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth but just as soon as i came to my senses i went back into that nihilistic depressive state hell even when i was brushing my teeth i was intentionally looking down to avoid looking at myselfand now here i am writing this fucking novel on reddit and for what to vent no you kinda have to have something youre passionate about in order to vent to garner sympathy to be honest i dont give a fuck about anybodys sympathy right now especially not that of internet strangers to get encouragement thats a laugh im pretty much encouragementproof in my current state to whore karma i dont give a fuck about anything right now especially not imaginary internet points maybe its out of habit i dunnothe thing is i almost kinda like it like this it feels like how i normally am is a lie and this state is the truth like i lie to myself to make myself happy and to make myself think theres some meaning to life but now that i know the truth my mind is free to drink smoke and stumble my way through life until i inevitably diewhatever nobodys gonna read this and it probably doesnt make any sense anyway,3.0

51201,pretty sure i am a psycopath i  have always had trouble trying to understand what others feel i dont feel sad when i see someone really sad or happy when someone is excited i have known this since i was very young and for all my life i have been trying to understand those things i dont understand how friends or family members communicate with each other how their discussion topics steer from one point to other along with a dash of humor for me things always go in a logical way i would try to reason and think for everything being discussed before speaking up i am a college student my friends would discuss about the problems with college life and others would join in chorus talking how it affects them and my mind goes straight to thinking what can i do to solve and improve the situation someone would say that he likes oreos and i would point out how the sugar compounds in the cream make brain release dopamine others would say i like it too i have learned such small things and am slowly learning to create such a fake conversation i also dont like talking about other people and gossip really bores me i dont trust new people easily i remember when i was a kid i would use my intellect to manipulate others i no longer do that i feel like i am always serious and tense which is why i dont have any real friends but merely acquaintances each and every decision i make is utility based and never have i considered my or the happiness of others in my case i simply dont know what would make me happy and so i go based on utility  best university more moneyin other peoples case i do get some idea of what they may want when i think hard about it basing on my past experiences but i have never been able to do so quick enough to influence my decision it usually is more of an afterthought i dont have trouble communicating since i have always been excellent in debates speeches and presentations and have won competitions as well i am extremely confident while on stage or even a onetoone conversation which has a clear purposeis there anyone else who has trouble with this,3.0

51211,what my depression tells me  another way of looking at i know how you feel been putting off my first post here for quite some time but it feels somewhat doable today so im gonna jump inthe following is a list of things my brain has told me over the years which i now recognize as false depression loves keeping me away from facing the anxiety and other emotions i feel instead sealing me in this purgatory where i abuse screens to hide away from fear shame and guilt maybe youll recognize some of these thoughts in your own life or get a perspective for how they feel true but arent apologies ahead of time dont know how to format yet on reddit and im on mobile also long warning the time has passed you by frame of mindyoure  and you havent been to uni yet your life is wastedi havent accomplished anything in my life yeteveryone around me is doing better than i ampeople younger than me are way happier and harder workingif i havent accomplished anything yet i wont be able to when im olderim always going to be as alone as i feelam right nowthe me vs everyone else frame of mindother people have it so much worse why arent i happyi have it easy i should be happythe fact that im on a computerphone right now means im luckier than most people why dont i act that waywhy cant i get a bfgf when its so much easier for everyone elseive ruined all my relationships with my friends why do i eat fast food all the time when i see friendsothers eating at fancy restaurantsi should end it so other people dont have to pick me up all the timeall my relationships feel onesided why am so never the strong oneeveryone likes my sibling more than methe selfpity frame of mindim not good enough to cook for myselfi dont deserve to be happyhaving fun is worthless i should be working hardat schoolnothing feels fun to me anywayi dont know enough to be able to talk about thatmy opinion doesnt matteryou cant even get up early youre patheticthe perfectionism frame of mindi didnt meditate in the morning so ill just do it tomorrow at night is a waste ill just do it in the morningsundaymonday were garbage ill be better next weekjust because i had a small success today doesnt make me successfulyoull only be happy when you have a full time jobare in school fulltimeexercise is meaningless today unless i do it tomorrow tooi need to have a string of good days to make a difference anything less is a wasteas i write this i realize that there are  billion versions of this talking to myself that ive experienced i can recognize that they are almost always unhealthy frames of mind or that they hold me back from becoming healthy or even allowing myself to feel happiness that being said i still cannot overcome these thought patterns most of the time but just recognizing them at all is a big healthy step if you recognize any of these as familiar or if you have some of your own that feel strong i urge you to share as i said in the title i know how you feeloften times that can be a very hard thing to hear from someone because they simply cant understand what youve experienced or what your emotions tell you everyone lives a unique journey to some degree but there is more crossover than you believe there is i want the list above to prove that i have gone thru very similar challenges as you have i want you to allow yourself to hear that other people face much the same fearguiltshameetc that you do and that there will always be someone who can listen that understands at least partiallynext time that someone tells you they know how you feel even if that isnt possibly true just stop and think about how that phrase makes you feel what is your depression telling you about it are they a liar are they just saying it to make themselves feel better are they just reaching for that because they dont know what else to sayor maybe its the opposite maybe theyve been thru some stuff and you could learn something from them taking a moment to think how true your thoughts are can be hugely beneficial question what your mind is telling you is this thought a blockade from facing harder emotions or is it factual im nowhere near done my journey and im going to need many hands up off the ground to be able to get thru it just writing this post is a hard step tbh again i would love to hear from you if anything in the list felt familiar to you or if you just want to talk in the comments,3.0

51243,a quick vent about why depression has made me tougher ok so a couple years back i was struggling with depression and once got to the point of holding a knife in front of my abdomen prepared to stab myself but to at least allow a better chance of survival but i turned away from it in the end before that day i was a cheery person who had a long fuse now i have what i would say is a dr jeckal and mr hyde scenario if im happy and all that im fine and normal if someone breaches the wall i will not hesitate to hit them if i know theyll be fine with it and i will enter my stone personalityquick disclaimer only my friends have broken the wall and the hitting is full force yes but they are fine afterword the worst ive dealt someone is a bruise the wall is relatively hard to breech but once it has been it takes about a day or so for my additude to fade offsemioff topic story one time in school we had a mental health meeting and me and my friend were talking about it later and they were saying how my life is good because of the money my family has i come from a long line of lawyers and that i should be happy and that my depression couldnt be that bad saying that my struggle wasnt real is one of the wall breakers from that point forward ive just constantly been reminded that depression isnt fixed by moneybut back to the topic at hand my stone personality is bacically i will not hesitate to put anyone who annoys me into a headlock if they continue and im not quite sure where it stems from maybe someone could think of a cause my depression was sort of kickstarted during a summer because i didnt do anything and my brain needs something to do otherwise it turns darkif youve made it to this line i thank you for taking a couple minutes of your day to read my long rant ,3.0

51315,do you think its possible to treat depression with herbs hello so i have diagnosed pdd generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder was in therapy for a lot of years was taking antidepressants the whole spiel im not someone who takes mental health problems lightly last time ive had a depression screening done half a year ago i was moderately depressed which is kind of the usual however due to different reasons mostly around the mental health care system in my country non usa i stopped taking my antidepressants about  months ago and about a month ago started using st johns wort drops instead i think its still too early to see if it works tho i do feel a bit better might be placebo and it seems like additional cup of chamomile tea in the evening helps me fall asleep so i was wondering if any of you have some experience with herbs and longer term effects of them,3.0

51317,what do people see in life i cant think of a more pointless thing than living i cant think of a better blessing than never being born im  female and have been on and off about my attitude towards life but the older i get the more i realise it is an absolute waste of time why would i want to study for so long and then go work for the rest of my life what do i get out of that absolutely nothing excites me about the concoction of bills cooking exercise work growing old with health problems and having a family if you ask me that sounds like absolute hell not to mention i am extremely unhappy with my appearance as in i never want to live with someone who will have to look at me without any make up there is apparently a very high chance i am infertile and i could not be happier about that this probably means i will never have to settle down and get married yay i am terrified of childbirth and i could never be a mother i dont even like kids at all infertility just gives me another reason as to why life is pointless sure i love being alone but there comes to a time where i will realise ive had my good run im just wasting space now and end it all for good i have been quite happy lately despite my life going downhill but even when i am feeling joyful i always remind myself i can kill myself whenever i want and that life will never be bad because i wont be alive to experience struggles there is no point to life i am not good at anything academically or as a hobby i only find joy in youtube browsing the internet video games and reading quite frankly i dont want to be interested i have this overwhelming apathetic feeling towards everything like it is too much energy to try and be an interesting person maybe thats why i enjoy my own company and i will end it once i get bored enough,3.0

51329,tired of living a meaningless life im only  i understand i might not understand things as someone who been through a lot of things but let me how it really is the first time something happened to me i was a child i was abused to the point of developing a speech problem i have scars on my body that will stay there for ever i was bullied to the point where i come home and spend few hours crying myself to sleep the first time i wanted to commit suicide i was  years old i started to struggle with meaning and whats the point of living i constantly questioned if this world is just made to make me suffer you dont a lot of   year olds thinking about this i was struggling so much when i turned  and a half i attempted suicide but survived and was sent to the hospital i was misdiagnosed with so many things until i found out i have ocd with seasonal depression that occurs with psychosis and than goes away and gad with panic disorder im on  of prozac and some benzodiazepines i been hurt so many times by my society parents girls friends all the people either used me or took advantage of me my therapist is trying so much with me than i literally feel that shes getting tired i keep apologizing to people that never give a shit about me and will never care i try to help people to the point where i feel useless but i never expect anything from them i feel so hopeless and so doomed to the point where i developed physical problems i cry none stop every day all because of memories and i usually cry on myself not people or anything i been treated like trash because of how nice i am what i have most people dont so i should be thankful i guess but whats the point if none really works im a state swimmer and on top of my class but this year i just gone down the hill and quit swimming and quit studying because i dont have motivation to even wake up i been in a depression episode since august of  i just feel helpless and cant do anything if trained professionals are trying their best and they havent succeeded with me and i change therapists and psychiatrists every year,3.0

51632,lack of motivation and zero satisfaction im not sure if ive come to the right place ive never been diagnosed with anything mental before but ive also never been testedive recently graduated from a stem degree and im totally lost i thought it would be good to have a year of less mind intensive work im working at an it service desk and earning a bit of money while living with parents by all accounts i have an alright comfortable life i wanted to spend my free time doing things i was a dungeon master with a dampd group but it fizzled out because my players got bored i started volunteering politically and got quite far but after about a month i cant find the motivation for it i was learning to drive but i just sort of stopped that i was learning to code but stopped that too i cant hold a gym routine it takes a lot of effort for me to go and see friends when id rather stay in and rot playing video games which i dont even find fun any more i have some other things i would like to do but im concerned that ill just find those unsatisfying too id rather hold them as distant that would be cool ideas rather than discover that nothing is gratifyingim just not really good at anything i cant handle it when i get things wrong my peers all seem to grill me for it i got through my degree just by memorising equations and derivations i dont think i display any other symptoms of depression when i was unemployed and just had these misc tasks and job hunting i definitely did show other more severe symptomsi fear that i do have something under the surface but that my fairly hectic day job prevents me from thinking about it can someone point me in the right direction,3.0

51726,hopefully this can help some advice on how to help with chronic depression and be ok with everyday life if you read the whole thing it may help depression is fucking horrible it can get so bad suicidal isnt enough to describe it those who know know my whole life i have been depressed and suicidal it feels hopeless as fuck most times yes drugs help but they wont fix anything for you you have to do that for yourself i want to help others so they dont end up in this cycle of drugs and sadness this post isnt so much about drugs but how to better yourselfhere is some advice that will hopefully help some going through similar mind states of helldont let the drugs do you do the drugs getting into an addiction while depressed will only make things worse look at yourself and how your lifestyle is at the moment think of how to improve shit like a good sleep schedule decent eating habit daily social interactions staying busy anything to not feel miserable for  or  seconds drugs make you feel not miserable right yes but will it actually fix anything just an illusion of feeling good for a little bit im not saying dont do drugs fuck that i love getting fucked up just as much as the next guy but learn not to rely on that shit just think of feeling okay without having to get high its a far vision i know but trust me learn not to depend on someone for your stability and happiness when they upset you you dont have anything to fall back on keep yourself grounded no matter the situation everyone could leave you and you could loose everything and it wouldnt hurt nearly as bad as if you put your life in their hands you need to find yourself sit down and think about what things you have and control and make those things better simple shit improving friendships cleaning your house doing things that will improve yourself get better at being okay with yourself and staying positive about who you are fuck what anyone thinks about you  learning to accept things is important try to figure out what you can change and what you cant drugs may seem like a solution but be careful playing with fire not seeing the whole picture and being ignorant will dig you deeper and deeper until drugs are the only thing that make you feel goodyou are the only person that you know will never leave you unless its by choice  you need to distract yourself its a skill to learn once you learn to change your thought process you can see opportunities to improve your life any way you can easier and this isnt some corny fake shit either  fuck all that meditation fucking you can do anything if you put your mind to it motivation shit count up every single thing that you fucked up or lost and if its possible try to fix or improve some of it learn how to live for yourself simple shit texting someone asking someone to talk doing a easy task if you feel like shit and youre in a corner do something that makes you feel accomplished thing of something you should do but dont really wanna do and distract yourself with it it will pay off trust me  hopefully this post helps at least one person because your own mind can kill you and its fucking terrible ,3.0

51869,a post that might help you i have seen a lot of people struggle with depression including me after a couple of cycles of depression here is what i realized at least for myselfdepression is egotistical i have compassion for everyone of you i know how it feels to be in torture and just cant find to have a piece of mind while all you wanna do is just lay and do nothing but you have to understand that sometimes depression is nothing but the ego trying to hold on itself there were times that i saw everything as negative and told myself lies that i was the only one to go through this other people dont know how it feels like that i am not normal and that the world hates mebut you have to understand every person on this planet has gone through it was it  weeks  month or a full year accept it and dont fall in the trap that you are the only one that has it rough there is always someone that has it worse than you i know it is very hard to acknowledge that and to let your ego to the side but it is the first step if you want to end your depressionsomething else that i figured out is that depressions meaning is to put down i came to the conclusion that depression is the burrying of our feelings we dont let our body express itself and we suppress our emotions what is the opposite of depression it is not happiness it is expression we live in a fucked up world that everyday we are told to shut the fuck up and work dont talk do this dont do that and most importantly we give our attention to our brains only every second of our day we are thinking shit we try to organize things or we are on our phones but the body is left out some people are so fucked up that they are emotionally numb they have supressed their feelings so much that they dont even have the impulse the urge in their body to feel anythinghere is what i suggeststart with the very basics learn to breathe deep as fuck i know you have heard it a thousand times all this shit with breathing you are thinking  i want a real solution not the same bullshit for every problem that i have  but it all truly comes from breathing the essence of life comes from it all people have developed neurological patterns that restrain the body from expressing what it feels the muscular system is often used as a way to suppress our breathing our expression of feelings try during the day to just bend your knees a bit and fall back with the chest being opened up and your hands being widely spread out as much as you can pay attention to nothing else but your breathing open your mouth and eyes very wide and just let the vibration to happen most likely your throat will be very tense as well as the diaphragm and the chest you might as well feel like choking or vomitting that is g o o d let it happen what is happening is the muscular system wants to hold on its tension take huge deep breaths and try to let your thoughts out of it do that  times a dayalso try going to a place where nobody can see you or hear you and just begin jumping up and down it will seem very weird and stupid at first but try to keep your logic out of itdont feel ashamed of it own it try making sounds hump and try to fit your voice to the perfect spot where it feels the most comfortable at and let it resonate go up and down and feel the relaxation in your neck and diaphragm i swear it will feel great you might get the urge to express feelings such as laughing crying or screaming usually the most suppressed feeling is anger so feel comfortable screaming as loud as you can rub your throat open it up and allow your vocal chords to reach their max volume beat your chest try also rubbing your cheeks and massage them while screaming from deep into your belly you need to make noise dont be afraid if your vocal chords start to feel pain you need to get it off your system all this energy that has been trapped within yourself please dont start thinking that if someone saw you doing all this they would think you were crazy and dont start thinking that this awkward it is not get some stuff with you maybe a punching bag some things that you dont need and start destroying shit apart make yourself feel that you are in control of your life by smashing everything that you have in your surroundings tear it apart throw it punch it kick it bite it whatever starts coming up just do it and go with the flow after that this can take from either  minutes or  minutes depending on your situation whenever you feel that you got it all out just lay on the floor shut the fuck up dont move and let the body relax feel the sensation of your blood going through your veins feel the sweat coming off your armpits your head your legs and your chest feel the overheat on your neck and shoulders from screaming open your ears and listen to the impulsive breaths that you cant control that happen in order to make up for the oxygen that your lungs used feel the tiredness and the draining out that you feel going off from your chest and to your exhales that come off hot out of your mouth now you should be in that position for at least  minutes stay there for as much as you feel like being you must be tired as hell now go home get a big glass of water go to your bed let loose and fall asleepif that doesnt work for you you must be one of those that have a chemical inbalance in their brain or you need to get even more extreme go crazy take a risk do something dangerousthis way you wont have time to think about your depression also disconnect from social media dont go to instagram or facebook or pornhub just let yourself be in its natural state with no overstimulation and let yourself feel boredi hope this helps some of you sorry for my english,3.0

51871,the world changed when i got depressed so we grow up thinking and learning that the world doesnt change just because we get sick or run into problems the world goes around as normal we are led to believe but in my case theres been one thing that has completely changed since my life started to go wrong its how people respond to me now that im lost and depressed as opposed to vibrant and well put togetheri have a high education and have been working for years in my field it has always given me a sense of stability to have my wits acknowledged and to able to connect to people easily and find the good in things i lived in a fancy apartment in a very good neighbourhood if i had to make a phone call to someone about something back then itd be with enthusiasm and about some minor detail like arranging a birthday party or getting a vaccine for my kid etc every communication that i had with people was pleasant or non dramatic i didnt have a reason to contact anyone to solve my problems well the relationship fell apart im the one who had to move out i never found a place to rent or buy after that its been  years now ive been renting many places for short periods as this has been all ive able to find my mental health has been going downwards for every year that has passed me by without a place to call my own ive had to call everyone and everything to fix my problems ever since its been one thing after the other because of the domino effect i cant find a place so that adds major stress i have to store all my stuff with family and with storage services find a place to keep my address figure out how to deal with that in conjuction to the fact that i have a kid with my ex and i cant just move my address far away without getting into trouble over it im just floating around out here like a balloon i wonder when ill completely float away life took a turn and everything changed its a nightmare and im performing miracles everyday just to make it into the next day but the problems keep piling up and the people the way they respond to me now ive found that everybody in my social circle is either a stranger now or apathetic towards my situation i have no adults to lean on and everybody puts this extra distance or contempt towards me ive had no help ive really discovered society as a cold place that has just laughed in my face when i needed it the most i feel used by society and thrown away like garbage every time that ive had to explain my ordeal to the municipality office or a doctor etc theyve talked to me like im stupid after learning that im stressed and depressed it somehow takes away my credibility as a person that ive become depressed everyone speaks to me in a baby voice and i just almost reject the world for what it has become to me now im just shattered into bits and pieces mentally and cant even find a beginning or an end to this mess it certainly feels like the dark night of the soul but more than that it feels like the world changed when i changed,3.0

51929,how do i know if i dont like something because of depressionpoor mental health or if i just dont like something university troubles unsure of degree choice advice needed please hello this is a long oneso ill spare you the details here but id been busting my ass to try and get on a reputable computer science course at university from when i was  or so until i got onto the course of my dreams at  i didnt specifically focus on cs as my degree option until i was  before that i was just interested in stem i had to do an extra year to get onto the course as i underperformed as in got average grades in my a levels due to a stress related breakdown noncs subjectsive put so much energy and time into getting onto the course that i completely burned myself out and ive messed up semester  really badly the support i was supposed to get from the uni wasnt provided to me and ive been in an awful place through last year but especially since september ive been asking for them for help along the way which is the most annoying part but ive received very limited help so i ended up being unable to complete over half of my coursework across the modules as soon as i fell behind i got in touch with all of the proper people but they didnt really do anything they said theyd do what ive turned in has been marked between  amp  though so im not entirely hopelessour exams start this monday and im pretty sure realistically im not going to pass some of them ive lost a lot of self confidence though with academia as a result of going from a top straight a student to an average one ive got to get minimum  in one exam to get  overall in the module which can be compensated another  need a minimum of  all of these exams are hard though and they require a good understanding of the content that i just dont have i know they dont sound like high percentages every time i revise i have uncontrollable panic attacks luckily  im eligible for mitigating circumstances due to ongoing family issues and my mental health issues mitigating circumstances are decided on an individual basis though and the board doesnt meet for another  monthsone option is resits but they mean you have no summer holiday and i know ill desperately need a break by then i had to resit last year due to family illness during the exam season which is primarily why i burned out the other option is retaking the year but my uni debt is mounting upthe uni just sort of says to show willing but im doubting whether i even like the course or the subject any more its such a mindfuck to put so much effort into trying to scrape a pass idk whether its just my depression and lack of time for hobbies making everything a chore or if i just dont suit the subject luckily this years marks dont count i just need a  average to get through to year  and have no module less than  which is the worry if im struggling this much now how am i going to do future years or am i just depressed with low self confidence meaning that im struggling i find the content is maybe  of interest i love learning how things work but i really dont have much interest in computer engineering and such i find it really hard to not forget it all the exams feature bits of the coursework too if i understood how to do the coursework i wouldve done it i honestly spent hours trying to work it outanyway the main problem is im not convinced that a cs job is for me either ive been thinking recently that id like to become a property developer fixing up houses and making them more environmentally friendly theres nothing worse i can think of than being trapped in an office under fluorescent lights all day with no windows sitting trying to fix code its probably just the gross cs building at my uni thats given me that impression though im first gen uni so i dont really know what graduates do my mums friends are cleaners and housekeepers and ive got major imposter syndrome as everyone acts like theyre better and smarter than each other and its just so toxic this lack of a positive future goal has really made me suffer with motivation for the projects we have to work on others seem to make all of these fancy code projects on the side go to hackathons and love creating new csy things but im just here with no friends and being probably the slowest person with the lowest grades on my course i guess cs careers ive looked up especially in the uk amp eu just seem somewhat tedious and limited but idk if the picture ive built is realistic i think the exercises we do are okay but theyre just okay theyre certainly not easy though only a problem when i literally cant do the first step and ive only enjoyed the programming modules tasks how do i know if these struggles are genuine or just mental health related though writing this post i want to sit here and fight for my place on the course and to get myself a way to break into the lucrative industry but then the other part of me says its just the sunk time fallacy and the fact it costs me £ to be here ive seen a building surveyor degree apprenticeship that seems interesting as i mentioned id love to do up houses but also to help people make a decent living wage doing so id like to worry less about bills than i did growing up and help preserve cultural environments and ecosystems as well as the environment itself i previously had great interest in product design so already have some cad skills materials knowledge etc my maths has always been decent amp even my average a levels meet the requirements you even get paid too haha the same as a minimum wage job if not more which means id actually be making money and not leaving my degree £ in debt maybe id even be able to pay off my £ debt by the time im finished of course theres no guarantee id get this apprenticeship and the university its from wont be as prestigious but its not the only one out there and my work experience should overrule that anyway i can email them to ask more but i dont know what to say i dont want to seem unstable and indecisive by mentioning that im still enrolled in my course but that ive been struggling please if anyone has any advice on how to see clearly outside the fog of depression to help me make this important life choice it would be so welcome is it just the case that i just like cs or something or more that i just like tech and programming not necessarily the whole package does the lack of a career goal matter right now is that a good enough reason to choose another path thank you so much in advance for any constructive thoughts advice or tips ill try to reply to all comments amp thank you for reading this far i know its long but im not very good at condensing things and this has been causing me a lot of pain over the past few days and im sure my writing is reflecting that sorry,3.0

52066,relapse i was doing well for quite awhile i got to experience the feeling of being okay for an extended period of time for the first time in my life i thought i was finally out of the hole ive been having a hard time with life lately i assume its because i am under a lot of unresolvable stress at the moment every other time before when i felt like this again it was expected even though it was hard to go back to that feeling it was familiartonight it feels devastating there wasnt one person that i could consider calling to burden with my negative fucked up thoughts i have friends but nobody really knows the extent of my depression i would have to provide a lot of information about myself for someone to truly understand why i feel this way i dont think i could trust anyone in that capacity i couldnt stop the sadness from consuming me  so i decided to turn to reddit for distraction this is my first time posting here im not sure what im expecting out of this but it has felt better to just let this out im sure many people here can relate to this and it gives me a little bit of peace knowing that someone understands ,3.0

52233,depression feels like its about to win not looking for sympathy just looking to understand what is wrong with me and if there is anything i can do i think ive been depressed for so long i forgot that the feelings i feel are abnormal today though it really hit me im  and living at home with my parents and  year old brother i am getting my masters in public health at a university near by i work for the school and have been with the same organization for over  years  i make more than double minimum wage plus a full tuition waiver aka my school is free i have a boyfriend of  years who i love more than anything and a dog that is essentially my child and best buddy my parents have money and are good people so why am i so tired of this im physically tired all day mentally drained and lonely i feel empty and without purpose i go to work and am bored out of my mind but im too socially anxious to ask for more to do or maybe i just dont want to work harder i like watching youtube all day while im at work because its easy but i hate myself for not deserving this position at all i dont have really any friends that i would actually hang out with and that makes me feel like such a loser and incredibly alone but at the same time people almost always exhaust me and i find them uninteresting most of the time even when i try my best to stay engaged with what they are saying im fit and active and really enjoy being outdoors but now even hiking swimming and exploring with my dog has lost its luster ive thought about joining a club on campus but i can never seem to make myself actually go i always have an excuse i recognize it as its happening but as the negative feelings swell i just dont care i have no motivation to change in the momenti hate my masters degree i hate the subject i hate the professors and i hate the ridiculous amount of homework they assign i can never picture myself actually doing anything professional related to this degree my bachelors was the same i ended up here because i was such a god damn perfectionist i couldnt accept a c grade in other classes and majors i had to switch to something i knew i could succeed at and although i am academically successful as i predicted im miserable what a mistake im so invested in this degree now and ive worked so incredibly hard but its all for nothing because i hate it i would drop out today but its paid forso what idiot would drop out of a masters degree  thats free so sometimes i say fuck it im quitting this boring ass job quitting school and ill figure it out after that but i cant im compelled by some internal force to stay and try to push through it make the best of it and actually accomplish something but i cant seem to be happy anymore i feel like dying a lot just because im tired of the game go to school to go to work to work and work and work and then die anyway ive travelled all over the world already and ive had some amazing experiences but im fine if i dont have anymore the rest of the world no longer interests me i dont want children because i find them irritating and gross i want to get married to my boyfriend but i have almost no one to invite to the celebration i feel him pulling away sometimes and it breaks my heart he left to go on a month long trip to nepal without me to volunteer it is destroying me but i dont blame him my selfloathing and dread for the future must not always be pleasant to be around i could give two shits about volunteering its not that i wish people to suffer i just dont give a shit about helping make it better i truthfully think i hate humans in general even when i try my hardest to not and convince everyone that im just like every other happy girl i think ive convinced most people thankfully i look and act very preppy pretty and polite in reality i find humanity disgusting and evil i trust literally no one at all and always anticipate the worst from strangers so im constantly on edge unless im at home im horrified by the violence and brutality ive seen us humans commit online i hate myself for being like this im tired i want to start over but have no idea where to start i have no passions or hobbies other than outdoor things and dogrelated things but i dont want to work outdoors or be a dog trainer i used to paint and draw daily but its been years since i found it enjoyable at all i play scenarios over in my head about lives i can still live if i just decide to change now but i cant change im too afraid of the unknown or of being a fool and regretting my decisionswhat do i do i see a therapist but it doesnt help that much i tried paxil and it made me sick and sleepless alcohol is the only thing that makes me feel free and normal but i hardly ever drink and have only been drunk about  times i cant talk to my parents because they came from so much less and worked so incredibly hard to get to where they are i cant talk to my boyfriend because he is so full of hope and joy for life it would pain me to let him see the disdain i have for it no friends id dare speak of this with all i have is my dog for many months he seemed to help but now i feel almost bored of him what is wrong with me,3.0

52251,the light has gone i dont know if anyone here is an expert in narcissist personality disorder i used to have a best friend a year ago we were friends for  years i used to overlook a lot of the red flags this person would show even when he was accused of rape i was loyal to him and i believed his side of the story this in and of itself caused me alot od grief as well he was popular in high school i was not after starting to spend more and more time with this person i began to feel miserable all the time he once told me i have your life by the balls he would say mean things about my family he would constantly say mean things about people and would put be down alot but just disguise it as joking after a while i became convinced he was a narcissist so i cut him out of my life i feel like i made the right decision a lot of the time but i dont like how i did it i blocked him from my life anyway i knew how and stopped talking to him for  long awful months he called me and sent me letters even though i told him we were not gonna hang out anymore after  months he finally got me on the phone at which point he called me a psychopath because i was trying to not show emotion in the conversation i knew that if i showed emotion that would only make him keep trying to force his way back in my life so i didnt show emotion while he cried and screamed at the top of his lungs and called me a stupid piece of shit i just sat there showing no emotion because i was convinced it was all a manipulative tactic i think about him every day and have dreams about him all the time i feel guilty often because i cant help but wonder what if i was wrong i hate myself and if the only thing keeping me from committing suicide is my family i cant do that to them i typed this up really fast because it physically hurts me if i think about the details too much i dont know why i typed this i guess i just wanted to get this off my chest whenever i meet someone new and they tell me im a good person i think to myself if they knew this about me they wouldnt think im a good person i just quit my anti depressants cold turkey and the withdrawal symptoms arent helping i hate myself so much im really tired of this life this was all over the place im sorry,3.0

52447,difficult year i am  yr old male in my final year of university the last year has been hard i suffer from panic attacks and anxiety which were prevalent while i was spending two semesters abroad this was difficult enough to deal with but when i arrive home the family dynamic has changed completely my father and mother seemed to have separated but have not announced it to us nine years ago my father has taken up reins of the family farm in his hometown after his brother died and he regularly came down on weekends as he has to manage the farm my mother didnt seem too keen on this from the beginning but went along with it nonetheless when i arrive back from abroad my mother has given up on this my dad rarely comes home now and if he does he sleeps in the guest room and they barely communicate my mother is also going through menopause and my brother sister and i have to deal with the mood swings when i asked my mother what the situation was she basically told me that it wasnt a marriage anymore if he was always up there at the farm and when she suggested counselling he refused to go i believe money is another factor as my dad is obviously struggling with a lot of debt and there isnt exactly gold made in a farm in the west of ireland home life has become very difficult for me because everyone is so tense and i am already under pressure with college work etc i cant help but feel angry and frustrated at my dad in all this he seems to have a very archaic mindset where he refuses to get another job because the farm has been in his family for generations and seems too proud to attend marriage counselling with my mother yet he acts all surprised and angry that she isnt acting like a wife ugh i just dont know how long i can take this situation anymore everyone is at each others throats and i just want some stability,3.0

52709,times change and so do friends when middle school started i had a group of friends who always loved to play games and honestly it was my only escape from what happens from my personal life they never asked and i enjoyed it because i rather be part of what my friends enjoy we all had xbox s and always found a way to get xbox live membership or sometimes i had a friend be kind enough to give me a  day free trial it was the best of times they were the only friends that stuck with me until times were changing its hard to move on when your friends begin to change and time itself keeps progressing high school was the peak of our group disbanding at senior year it was also the time people were changing consoles into a new era of gaming i accepted it without frustration of losing my friends and enjoyed playing games with story and continuing my life but then today i suddenly broke down i look at myself in the mirror and almost didnt recognize myself i felt empty i started looking back at my old account on xbox and looked at all my achievements my friends list and then i started to remember all the good times i miss them i miss the way my friends used to only put their mind into our friendship and the game how we bond and talk about things and now they are just goneits just sad that no matter how many times i try to figure out what went wrong i only find myself at a dead end that this happens i end up blaming myself for the group disbanding it makes me feel lost in a way seeing that i remember these moments yet do they also think about them too i tried messaging them and trying to hang out with them but they either say they cant make it live far or they just have a totally different personality maybe it is that times are changing and maybe im just stuck in the past i still wish them the best in their future i still have great memories of them and have no regrets meeting them i just wish that maybe ill have one friend just one pal to share these nostalgic moments with to watch them or me play the games we enjoyeven just thinking about all of this reminds me of the movie stand by me those are the only friends ill meet in my life ill only be young once and to see it gone i just wish i could live with it forever i hate the idea of growing up as if it takes our childhood i just hope someday that can changethank you to anyone that reads this and to anyone that goes through this kind of scenario i have this to saylove yourself not everyone is going to be nice neither will they be there always but the memories stay forever thats why we live to feel to care to be happy ,3.0

52952,dear everyone on this subreddit you are all amazing people and i love you so a lot of people on this subreddit need to hear this you are cared for people do care about you whether it seems like it or not there are tons of people out there whether it be family members close friends significant others relatives or even just friendly people on reddit that care a lot about you i feel incredibly bad for anyone on here who is depressed as i know what it feels like to think the world hates you and no one would even notice if you were to kill yourself but that is not true no matter what situation you are in now it will get better someday and you can even try and help yourself now  first of all if you arent going to therapy you might wanna try that therapy isnt for everyone yes i really just said that but ive tried a couple different therapists myself and they didnt help me much but you should at least try it and stick with it if it is helping even a little bit secondly try going on a walk getting some fresh air is good for you as you need vitamin d anyways even if its just a  minute walk outside once a week its good to at least get out of the house and try your best at feeling better if you are stuck in your house and finally just do simple things that you enjoy dont feel guilty for constantly playing video games watching tv or anime or just laying in bed if it genuinely cheers you up doing little things you enjoy everyday is a great way to feel a little better so definitely try itand if youre thinking about killing yourself have already attempted before please do not try again there are so many people who care about you even if you dont think so i mean heck even the music teacher at my school cares when random people die to the point where she will sometimes cry over it so please dont think no one would care and if youre in the mindset that youll be dead and its doesnt affect you then still please dont if someone you really care about were to kill themselves youd be devastated as well and no one wants you to go especially because you will eventually get over it if you try and help yourselfand for those who think it wont get better trust me when i say it does i was incredibly depressed for a few months due to a verbally abusive ex and almost killed myself multiple times but now although i am still depressed it has gotten better and i even have found the love of my life and am incredibly happy right now because we started dating today lol so it will get better and if you ever need someone to talk to come to me or anyone else on this subreddit if you feel like killing yourself make a post here before you do and wait for some replies wait for some people to try and cheer you up because no one here wants you to kill yourself your life is important to all of us and i really just want you all to be safe and happy because my ultimate life goal is to make sure everyone is happy it always has been and always will so i will try my best to make you happy if you are feeling down despite not even knowing you because it is always a great thing to be positive although being too positive can be draining   i hope this post helped some of you i really do if it made even one of you happy or reconsider suicide or even cry then ill be satisifed and take my  upvotes knowing i made  people feel at least a little better tonight   i hope you all have a good daynight wherever you are in the world,3.0

52959,depression is a demon depression isnt just a disease its a fucking demon it destroys you from the inside taunts you constantly takes over your mind it breaks you into little pieces and takes away your will to put them back together it turns you against yourself makes you succumb to its demands it makes you despise yourself and everything about you it makes you want to destroy yourself just as much as it wants to destroy you and it succeeds it turns you into a shell of a human it takes away every passion you have and makes you hate it it makes you push yourself away from society so you cant get help then it torments you alone it talks to you constantly and tells you things you cant block out it tells you how terrible you are and how much everyone hates you it tells you the world wants you gone and you believe all of them every word it says to you it slowly breaks down your humanity making you unable to talk sleep study live normally and soon its the only thing in your mind its pushed everything else out everything and everyone you once loved is replaced by despair you hurt yourself over and over and over because depression had convinced you its what the world wants and after you do that depression convinces you its not enough convinces you that its best if you leave for everyones good for the good of everyone you used to love and every time you try to push it out it comes back stronger pushes you into a tiny box where theres nobody to listen to except it and you keep fighting it keep trying to live a normal life but its taken over your mind youre so lonely and its convinced you you deserve it and you try to negotiate with it but its stronger and you always end up crying on the floor with a knife in your skin as it fills up your mind more and more eventually its taken everything from you you realize you cant escape it and thats when its taken the very last piece of your mind you have no more tears left to shed youre a mere shadow of the person you once were you believe everything its ever said to you every cut youve ever given yourself starts to bleed all over again every horrible thing youve said about yourself starts to ring in your ears and then it swallows you completely youre gone youre now another soul of millions the demon has destroyed from the inside outim  ive been living with taking over my mind since i was  and its been so hard im so lonely i never got to do any of the things adults reminisce about while the other kids were having fun with friends outside i was crying in my closet bleeding but i somehow pushed myself through years of it hoping someday it would go away elementary school middle school high school every year has been increasingly hellish countless medications therapy nothing has worked nothing kills it it took away my entire childhood i dont think ill make it past ,3.0

53031,i really thought i was better my depression was behind me then everything came crashing down im spinning out of control this will be a long probably boring pointless rant im a  year old woman girl whatever i have severe depression ive had it for  years i really thought it was over a month and a half ago i was happy at least i was telling myself i was then the man i was in love with left me things had been bad for a while he was abusive i was convinced that the toll it was taking on my mental health was the problem i was getting too upset acting too irrationally not making enough of an effort to keep him happy etc ive now accepted that it wasnt my fault despite this ive never felt more sad and lonely and hurt i thought id feel free from his grasp but all i want is him to talk to me my depression was creeping back in towards the end of our relationship but now its unbearable id take back those days in a heartbeat i spent the first month hanging around train stations for hours on end looking for the courage or maybe the cowardice to jump i could never bring myself to do it thered be a child there or id think of my dog never knowing why i didnt come home or id just be too scared now all i do is lie in bed i flick between the same  apps until i can justify going to sleep im missing work i dont have the strength to see my friends ive lost so much weight because im just not hungry i dont want to eat a lot of my clothes are too big for me now im on the road to becoming dangerously thin im abusing my prescription medication to keep myself sedated so the days go by faster im on effexorvenlafaxine im taking that as prescribed  in the morning  in the evening its strange i think it might help a little bit but it has destroyed my sleep leading me to abuse my seroquelquetiapine it makes me so sleepy i cant control myself but since starting effexor i now only get about  solid hours sleep leading me to take more seroquel to get back to sleep sometimes ill wake up again ill take more im going through it  faster than i should be and im scared that my doctor will notice and take it away from me sleep is the only escape i have ive also fallen quite hard into illegal drugs my ex introduced me to ecstasy it was like nothing id ever felt because i was happy at the time it made everything a hundred times more beautiful now that im using while im sad it just fucks me up but the buzz is better than feeling empty im rolling once a week at least the one thing he always told me was to test your drugs if you dont know where they came from he said it could kill you i found a dealer and am purposely not testing them i hope they do kill me ive been looking for other things to try to see if i can get that same feeling back i once had im becoming tolerant to molly its destroying my brain slowly i know it is i just dont care the nights that im not high im drinking the other night i visited my exs sister she talked to me and really listened she supported me wholeheartedly i felt so cared about we were drinking us and her neighbours i drank so much that i was happy and loud and fun we had a good time one of her neighbours smoked weed and invited me to join ive never been able to get high off weed i dont know if it was just the alcohol but i was gone exs sister let me crash at hers i lay on the sofa then got up to charge my phone i was so fucked up that i passed out as soon as i stood falling and crashing into the table i broke her vase ive never been more disgusted and humiliated with myself she had been so kind to me and i had broken one of her belongings that she loved im a mess im in online therapy but i hate it it isnt like talking to a real person i have to return to university in a month ill have to get a part time job to be able to afford my rent i dont want to face people i dont want to work i dont want to speak i dont want to move i dont want to be here i just want to die,3.0

53054,i want to try and get better and need some advice uk i dont really know if this is a good place to post this but here goes firstly im not looking for sympathy or for someone to tell me its going to be okay i need to know if theres anything i can do to get better if things dont get better im going to kill myself i dont know when maybe in a week a month maybe a year or multiple years i already have a plan and the means to effectively and peacefully od id just have to write some letters and make a few last trips to see some friends if something bad happens or i get into a bad place i can see myself going through with this its already something i consider seriously everyday so i have a choice to make i can die or try maybe one day i could enjoy living and maybe even be okay with who i am but i always end up back being depressed and thinking about how worthless i am i tried getting better before but i was  and more naive i tried mental health services in uk and from my experience they werent helpful i turnt up said i was struggling to feel good about myself or the world filled out questionaires and they essentially said great have some pills of course that didnt work because i have reasons to be unhappy drugs dont fix the problems they might just take the edge off and offer relief so i went for a check up got off the meds and they sent me to some groups that were mainly filled with a bunch of middle aged divorced people i wish they were as good at making people happy as they were with power points because to be honest it was just like googling self help questions now im  years down the line and im just so sick of doing the same shit on a different day with nothing ever making me any happier and my problems have only gotten more complicatedthe kicker is that i have aspergers syndrome which means major parts of the human experience are damaged for me its not depression but its a cause for it i used to get bullied and picked on a lot for being different im high functioning now so i can get by and talk to people fairly well but im aware of the ways im different from other people i know i cant ever feel fully connected to people and i struggle with expressing love and its one of the worst feelings to feel like youre separate from others its like living with a wall around me i dont see a point to keep on living if i cant be my true self or connect with others it makes me feel embarrassed and like a freak ive managed to go  years and found nothing that i enjoy doing and nothing im good at ive considered private therapy to help but i dont have money for it i dont want to kill myself but at the moment i cant see another way out im so sick of living in this body im so sick of my own head and this endless cycle i have no idea what options i have,3.0

53085,coming somewhat out the other side ive been depressed since i was about  years old now  ive been through the usual rising and falling of hopelessness not knowing why i continue to try not knowing why life is worth living thinking about how i should kill myself daily etc ive experienced highs and lows through out these fourteen years or so but ive never gone more than a week without considering how i should end my life though sometimes its more disassociated than others ie why should i kill myself vs whats  the best way a person can kill themselves anyway i thought it would be good to share something positive to this sub and maybe show some other people that life can get better regardless of how long you have to waiti still think about killing myself fairly often but life is finally starting to get better im in a relationship with a wonderful girl she has her share of issues but i love her none the less and for the first time in seven years i have a job lined up that isnt a complete dead end ive tried to finish my college degree three separate times and never could because i couldnt see the value in it vs the debt i would accrue but the job im getting is at a college that offers free tuition if i stay for a full year and continue to stay until i complete my degree the job also pays almost double every other job ive ever worked and has great benefits because its unionized my girlfriend is very supportive granted she needs a lot of my support too but it helps me not obsess over my own depression as much anyway when we first starting dating i misguidedly thought it might cure my depression altogether since i was so lonely hadnt dated seriously if at all for over three years but i quickly realized it wasnt an end all be all cure to my problems though it greatly helped besides it would be unfair to put that type of pressure on the relationship anyway having the expectation of fixing all my issues on her that is but overall this is the first time in my life that i feel like its worth toughing out the next five years to see what might happen versus making legitimate plans to kill myself once my future plans are finished originally i was going to kill myself about a year ago but my best friend asked me to be his best man when he got married and i didnt feel it was reasonable to put him and his wife through that then i was going to again but my dad had major surgery and i wanted to be there for him since he was there for me so many times then i started dating my current gf and didnt want to hurt her either i know im fortunate that i have so many wonderful people in my life that i feel its worth sticking around for them even if not for myself and thats something not a lot of other people on this sub feel like they have but i still feel all of your pain  i still want to end it all more often than not just to escape the pain of existing but i promise it gets better maybe not enough for everyone but enough for some and if youre reading this maybe itll get better enough for you too life isnt great its not a special experience especially if you believe like i do that we have to do it all over again when we die but that doesnt mean it wont get better good luck everyone and if youre reading this i know life is hard but please know and remember that im proud of you for making it this far,3.0

53349,depression hello in need of some advise i have a  year old greyhound who i have had for  year and i am thinking of giving him up the reason for this is because of my lack of motivation due to my anxiety and depression i never walk him because i cant seem to make myself go out the house i stay at home all day and it seems the only time i ever clean my house is when i have something to look forward which is another story but anyway due to not walking my dog he wees in my house and even poos sometimes he is wrecking my house he chews my carpets eats anything in sight and i just cant cope with him i really do love him but he is ruining my life i cant even take him anyway because he destroys other peoples houses too i think because he is a working dog he needs lots of walks to release his energy and because i dont i think he is using that energy on ruining my house i know i sound cruel but i really am depressed and i feel really bad for him i just need to know what would be the right thing to do if i did get rid of him i would be very upset,3.0

53478,im better but not safe followup post i recently told a friend who ive known for a while something ive been wanting to say for ages i thought that saying so would be the final nail in the coffin for our friendship heck even us knowing each other but nolife didnt pause didnt stop at the shock and awe at whatd id said it just nodded and kept movingit wasnt anything disgusting or horrible just me saying im not interested in something anymoreand that id prefer not to do said thing but for weeks maybe months the thought of telling them ate me up i told myself dont do it youll be a dick a moron and grow distant from another friend but so far nothingit could still be the end of my friendship with them that moment could of triggered the process of moving on with our seperate livesand the worst part is if thats truei cant stop itthat same day i told them i threw my thoughts into a reddit post not expecting much but in the end i got a reply that has started to help meget over it not my nagging fear of loosing friends not my fear of starting over with new friendsjust solice in knowing it will be okit feels like the climax to a tv show has just happend the problem has been resolved and now i can move onbut i know that will take time more nights of worrying more days of discomfort and alot more selfdoubt is coming still not every problem or worry ends walking into the sunsetbut now i know what to do to make things easierim starting to cruel out of the hole i dug for myself and now i need to hold tight and keep moving because thats all i can dokeep moving and know theyll be a better day week month or even year ahead,3.0
53479,if i cant do this alone cant help myself and nobody is around to hold my hand then what can i even do i feel so weak my friend killed himself last weekend and it turned my entire life upside down what was a happy semester turned into an absolute nightmare and the depression i finally got under control is the worst its been in a long time its so dark and alone i didnt sleep last night just cried consistently for hours i feel so fucking hopeless my violin professor lets me cry in her office and shes one of my only comforts my so doesnt really know what to do and thats not his fault im convinced its because nobody can help besides comforting me and making me feel less alone alone alone alone alone i am so alone whats a worse feeling than laying wide awake watching the sun creep up eyes almost swollen shut from crying for hours straight and knowing that you are all alone there with nobody except you to pull you out of itif im too weak to help myself and nobody is around to offer support what can i even do accept the inevitable nothingness of feeling so lost and isolated with no way out all i can do is hope my tears dry up eventually so i can see at some point but the feeling is still there the empty the nothing the grief such intense sadness that i would do anything to stop feeling it i am so incredibly tired of feeling like this it is taking everything from mei have to live with the fact that i peaked in high school when i got accepted into this world renowned music school and have done nothing better since i stopped practicing i do poorly in class and i have very few friends in the music school i simply do not have the motivation to rise above mediocrity my life is ruined i have no hope,3.0

53628,just a depressive rant i just turned  a few months ago ive had major depressive disorder for over  years thats slowly built up from the regular depressive disorder that ive had for  to  years i only got diagnosed with this year with any of it but i know for a fact that ive been messed up for a long time i have medication and my psychiatrist says that its a good dosage for me i just feel slightly more motivated and am able to focus on my problems i dont actually feel any happier im balding and its bad i never noticed until recently because my brother has been loudly pointing it out in front of other people so now i feel insecure people tell me that i look  years older than i actually am and its disheartening ive never really cared about my appearance before because i found it impossible to really care about anything it shouldve been painfully obvious what was happening i even noticed signs and symptoms but i was too stupid to make a connection my hair looks worse than my  year old dads and again im only i wanted to at least dye my hair but at this point its not possible itll look like shit and damage my already damaged hair further when im off my medicine i dont feel any different when thinking about the state of my hair because i feel like nothing matters anyways now that im on my meds i feel extreme hopelessness and despair its easily ruined my holidays when it was brought up and multiple other days i stayed up for hours last night because i couldnt stop thinking about it no matter how much i wanted to just fall asleep to forget about it i keep pushing off going to a doctor because i dont want to hear what i think theyre going to tell me that nothing can be done and im just going to be stuck getting progressively worse for the rest of my life i may end up going today out of absolute desperation and will probably come back home never wanting to leave my bed again i lost  pounds over  months last year and im still not to a body that im happy with even though im on pretty much slipping into the underweight category now it seems like nothing that i have tried to do helps me and everything around me just keeps getting worse i hate it all i just want to be normal and experience a normal life,3.0

53787,its because of the universe i wasnt superstitious or anything before but after fighting it for so many years i believe its the universe fault everything that happened in my life is because of someone else i have been sexually abused as a child and instead of blaming those responsible i blamed myself for my actions though out my teenage life to top it all when people found out about it usually told by the abuser  they made fun of me with insults like man whore and other stuff so in order to avoid it i had to be extra nice to everyone so they wouldnt say those things to me which put a dent to my personality because i  cant really say what i am thinking to anyone my best friend dont even know who i really am or what i am up against i lost all my confidence after  things started to get a little better i didnt had a connection with my father to him i was like a son who he had to provide for no emotional connection at all when relation with my father started to get better he got sick amp died within a year after him my mother took all of my fathers inheritance to make the matter worse after  month of his death she had a secret affair with my fathers friend who later died in an accident exposing her secret to everyone because of my dysfunctional family amp circumstances i feel miserable thinking about ending it gives me relief for few moments then its back again even when i try to stay positive something happens which kicks all motivation miles away this is like a  time i have observed that whenever after extreme effort i try to be positive something bad happens not because of me but because of somebody else which makes me miserable again i am starting to believe universe hates me amp want to punish me its always one after another thing very few people have this many bad things happen to them from the very beginning and i dont think whatever this is will stop happening unless i forcibly put a stop to it idk if this makes any sense or not but stillenglish is not my first language so forgive my mistakes that i have made above      ,3.0

53801,thoughts on being depressed and unemployed yet still keeping strong  to myself and all of you lovely people going through the same shit its hard to land on a decent job with depression and anxiety then being unemployed  no income just make you more depressed and desperateive been in this vicious cycle for a long time its just so difficult to get out of it and it really gets addictiveid advice to work with one problem at a time i say first thing first we have to be mentally strong and healthy to get the rest of the boxes checked try to think positively dig deep into your mind find something you love to do and try to do it often whether its exercise painting cooking learning a new language anything its okay to fall out of the new routine at the beginning remember anything youre doing is progress really just start somewhere youll find something more along the way try not to dwell on the past or feel bad about the present you because its not the person who you really are youre way much better than that you have to keep that in mind one more thing if you dont feel well physically go see a doctor dont delay normally we wont see a doctor when we got a flu because we have a healthy immune system but when were depressed our immune system weakens due to the inevitably poor diet and sleeping pattern as a result it wont work well to fight bad viruses in our body  just granted us  more beautiful opportunities hope we can make one of them go in our way cheers guys ,3.0

54019,increased suicide risk when starting antidepressants as someone who has taken many antidepressants over the years i wish someone had taken the time when i first started taking them to explain why so many of these medications can potentially increase your risk of suicide when you first start taking them first off i want to say i know many people have many differing experiences with meds so i know this is not going to be the case for everyone i just want to share my experience and my psychiatrists and therapists reflections on my experience in hopes of helping people understand what is behind this risk of antidepressants in a lot of cases this is also not a statement of whether i believe antidepressants are good or bad in general that is a whole different discussion that i dont want to get involved inwhat my experience has taught me is that if i have suicidal ideation before i start taking an antidepressant that suicidal ideation is going to persist for some time even after i start to see mood improvements from that medication how that comes into play with increased suicide risk is that many times when i start to take a new antidepressant i am often too depressed to follow through on my suicide plans but as my mood improves i reach a point where even though i am still extremely depressed my mood has improved to the point where i am much more willing and able to follow through on my suicide plans the worst part is that it actually almost feels good when i am at this point i feel like i am in control a few years back i brought my observations to my psychiatrist as well as my therapist to see if this made any sense to them and to my pleasant surprise they told me this experience is not unique to me many other people experience the same sort of thingi wish i had known that years ago to know what to expect when i have severe suicidal ideation and i am starting to take a new antidepressant there were several times in which i wouldve taken additional precautions such as informing my practitioners and other supports and even considering hospitalization before it became an emergency situation hospitalization is definitely something you want to consider beforehand if you are concerned a medication change might lead you into crisis waiting until you are in crisis to consider hospitalization is a much worse situation to be inlastly youve probably noticed that i havent mentioned any medications in particular because while several antidepressants have had that effect on me some have not and more importantly not every antidepressant affects everyone in the same way im not looking to discourage or encourage taking any medication in particular that is a personal decision that should be made with the guidance of an experienced professional i know that majority of people starting a new antidepressant are not going to harm themselves or even have increased thoughts of suicide im just trying to help guide people through situations that i have found myself in  i hope my experience has been at least somewhat informative to some of my fellow peeps out there in melancholia best of luck,3.0

54099,i should see a professional but im scared so the feeling of having little interest in doing things even things i know i want to do has been a common feeling ive been feeling as long as i can remember everyone including myself has always brushed it off as me being lazy or not trying hard enough and ive always been afraid to talk to people my mind goes blank in conversations with people im not comfortable with im horrified of confrontation in certain scenarios ive always thought this was kinda normal and maybe it is and ive always been described as being shy and ive accepted that i am shy but over the years its gotten worse and worse and i began calling it social anxiety because i heard the term being thrown around more and more but never did anything about it and that got worse along with my lack of motivation and its a bit of a long story but there was a thing with this girl i liked and that hit pretty hard and threw me all out of wack so i started paying for an online subscription to one of those online therapists and she suggested i have depression and that i should see my doctor about meds i dont know if i was ready to be told im depressed cause if anything it definitely hasnt been making me feel better and heres the thing im  years old and i dont know how to find myself a doctor or a psychiatrist whenever i try searching online i get really stressed and end up stopping but i feel that i need to talk to someone about this kinda stuff and im definitely down for trying meds if thatll help i dont want my sad moods to be affecting my personal relationships or my education or future and that really freaks me out but i just get so overwhelmed when i look at different doctors and therapists and insurances and reviews and ive always had a hard time choosing things so yeah,3.0

54246,for the first time in about a decade i think ive hit a wall and its time i found help i dont know what im looking for here i think im just looking to ventim not sure how relevant it is but heres some background ive struggled with depression for pretty much the entirety of my adult life it started early in undergrad i spent the first few years just putting on a show that i was fine but really not handling it well behind the scenes  this ultimately culminated in the lowest and scariest few days of my life i ended up having a bit of a breakdown in  that resulted in a clinical depression diagnosis medication and seeing a therapist for a little while i didnt really see a noticeable difference when medicated so eventually i just stopped taking it and stopped scheduling appointments with my therapist after like  months for no good reason since then things have been up and down ive felt like shit a majority of the time but ive found ways to cope  i ran until injuries put a stop to that always keep my apt clean and orderly recognize when negative thoughts arent realistic etc  and generally things have been fine enough to get me through  years of grad school and a couple years of working and ive been able to just grit my teeth and get through rough times but recently i feel like ive just hit a wall and things that have helped me get my head straight in the past just arent really helping and im on a downturn that just feels different than in the past its not as serious as it was in  but given my history its concerning enough to me that its time i found professional help before things get worse one thing about being a student for so long is im really unsure where to turn right now in the past i could just walk into the student health center for any problems i had and the person at the desk would just point me to wherever i needed to go to get my issue resolved so im just trying to navigate what i need to do to get in and see someone its not so serious that its an emergency so im trying to figure out if i can just schedule with a psychiatrist directly or if i need to get a referral which means id need to get a primary care physician established probably either way its just frustrating to deal with and honestly its overwhelmingbut im sick of feeling like this and something has to changeanyway i just needed to vent,3.0

54404,feeling hopeless so heres  story ive been dealing with major depression and anxiety for most of my life it come and goes as it pleases my last episode before this one was  years ago i really thought i was finally out of it until nowthis past july i started to notice the changes in myself but just thought it would pass in november i spent an afternoon plotting different ways i could end my life at this point i realized this was not a funk i was already deep into a depressive episode i ended up quitting my great job because i struggled to even to basic daily tasks i isolated myself from all friends and family for months  i was sleeping for most of the day and barely eatingin december i admitted defeat and went to the doctor and explained everything him i was then set up with a phych who prescribed cymbalta after trying it out for a few weeks and even going up in doses i still felt like shit i would feel good for the first week then nothingso now im taking a cocktail of pills that are supposed to be making me feel normal but i feel the farthest thing from iteveryday im taking cymbalta wellbutrin seroquil zopiclone and also some birth control pillsi feel like every time they throw a new drug at me i feel great for a few weeks but it never gets past that im going to therapy i dont drink i dont smoke i see my psych every week and go to groupsi feel like im doing everything possible to feel like myself again but im honestly losing hope i no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel even if this episode does end there will always be another one coming i cant live knowing that i cant be cured from this illnessdoes anyone else feel this way im just so frustrated with myself constant changing of the medications this started for me in july i really thought id be feeling better by now i cant manage this anymore,3.0

54539,i feel like my pdoc is presbribing me things just for kickbacks heres a little background on my situation ive been on and off different meds for depression and anxiety since high school through high school and most of college i was on ssris i think just paxil and lexapro when i graduated and moved i stopped taking them and went a while with no meds my depressionanxiety came back after a while and i found a psychiatrist my insurance accepted this doctor had me get a dna test which showed her which meds might work better for me than others pristiq was one of the only ones in the green column so i ended up taking that which worked well for me i was on it for around  years when it felt like it just stopped working so i ended up going med free again to just test the waters and see if how i would do with just therapy   it didnt end up working so i went to another psychiatrist closer to my house she was very nice and asked what i had taken before and i told her everything i mentioned above she decided to put me on a  sample of trintellix a newer drug that works different from ssris and snris  didnt do anything other than make me nauseous so she bumped me up to  still nothing up to  nothing went to  and started getting stomach issues and sexual side effects but no changes in depression or anxiety her response to that was to drop me down to  and add in rexulti and she said if that didnt work wed try vibryyd another newer name branch drug   my insurance only partially covers trintellix rexulti and vibryyd so id still be paying over a hundred dollars i told her this i took meds in the past that worked for me at the time i told her this yet she continually insists on me trying this name brand drug i cant afford just to see if it works she doesnt want to put me on an ssri because if you stopped taking them then they must not have been working the thing that really got me was when she said they were low on trintellix samples and pulled out her phone to personally text the rep who she referred to by name to bring more that combined with her insistence on me trying an expensive drug that does not work for me makes me think she is getting kickbacks from these companies has anyone ever run into anything like this before should i ask for a different provider or just find a different place to go entirely thinking about talking to my primary care doc,3.0

54586,so its confirmed that im a debbie downer it honestly did hurt to hear the answer come from my friends but at least they were honest about it and didnt lie to me its better to hear the truth than lies i bet youre probably wondering why im posting this and that this sounds stupid well the reason why im posting this is because i deal with very depressive mood swings which make me a debbie downer i dont know if thats a sign of depression since ive never been diagnosed or if im just sad and itll pass but before it happened frequently everyday i would wake up sad go to school sad go home sad the anxiety made it even worse last year i was so unhappy and at the time i truly wanted to die well surprise surprise people noticed that people saw the mood swings and i presume to think they thought i was crazy which is true in a way but i just wish people would understand when i talk about mental health i wish my friends understood but no everyones so caught up in themselves they dont think about the ones closest to them sometimes i dont want to take my problems to the internet or my journal sometimes i just want the people who truly care about me to listen to how i feel just like how i do for themthey look at my depression or anxiety as a sign of craziness since im not running the streets and gossiping and having a smile on my face  because i lean moreover to the other side of the scale im considered crazy and a debbie downerim sorry that i cant smile im sorry that my life isnt so youthful im sorry that i live and feed off of my fears and anxiety im not normaloh im too shy im too quiet talk sorry that i like to live in a peaceful silence i envy those who have popularity i envy those who have great friends i envy those who can actually live life to the fullest and not let anything or everyone stop them because i sure do i dont want to be considered a debbie downer because im quiet and of course youre going to be a debbie downer when youre sad because youre sad i wish sometimes i could live in my own little bubble i wish i had my own world that i can create anything i desire but fantasies are just fantasies sighs in anxiety and depressing thoughtssorry i just needed to vent if you read through this thank you,3.0

54720,im so sad  mfor the past few months i have been really depressed and having really bad anxiety im always so sad tired bored and i keep getting weight on my chest my social life is so fucking broken i moved country last summer and i had around  close good friends but one of them would always call me ugly and stupid all the time for around a year it didnt effect me at first but as time went on and he kept saying it i started to really believe it he was doing it as a joke too he didnt do it to just me but after  months of this i started to hide my face from people and had really bad self esteem other people around me started calling me stupid too especially my mother when she got angryafter i moved country i got really sad about it school wouldnt start for another  months for me due to difficulties so i would spend all my time in my room playing video games as it was the only fun thing i could do at this point i was already miserable but when school started it got a lot worse i have very bad social skills and i have trouble speaking since i have a severe stutter and have turrets so when i stutter i violently shake too so due to this i never spoke in class when i did i tried really hard to not stutter and in doing so i could never really say what i wanted this made me have no friends and everyone finds me very weird in school i never speak to anyone in class i only talk when someone else tries to start a conversation but i end up panicking and saying something weirdmy brother at this time also suffered a head injury and lost his personality completely me and him were really close as he was the only one i could talk to and hangout with this loss made me completely give up and i started having really bad panic attacks and hypnic jerks at night so i could never sleep now i have been skipping a lot of school because it makes me feel so empty and lonely my attendace atm is  and the school is pressuring me into going which puts a lot of pressure and worry onto me i have spoke to my parents about this and they are really trying to help me but theyre christian so they make me read the bible and pray they dont want me going to a therapist either im really scared about my future i have no idea what im going to do i need to study but i really dont want to i really want to kill myself so i dont have to worry about all of this its all i can think about anymorei have no one to talk to about this not my parents not anyone at school and i know no one in my area everyone just thinks im weird so im honestly making this post as a relieve i really want someone to talk to about all this i have such a big pressure on my chestthanks for reading ,3.0

54843,dont do what you love for people that dont love what you do depression has seriously been kicking my ass around the past month and a bit so i thought it was time to create a dedicated account to vent my worrieswas a talented coder when i was younger won national championships and so on fast forward health got the best of me and i ended up needing surgery or otherwise id die this went fine and even got into uni on time with the rest of my peers my age ended up studying mathematics amp comp sci for a year before the rent became too much for someone that was doing freelance and i had to move homein order to pay for uni locally i started working this job went shit with new management and they basically just used and abused me to make their systems government compliant so they could start taking on gov contractsgot poached about a month ago by a much larger company which is a nice feeling the part they dont tell you though is that when they work you this hard you burn out and end up hating everything you loved to do i have no passion anymore and my head constantly hurts im constantly dazing off and i have been feeling physically ill for the past  months but every doctor says it is nothingso as i sit here at work constantly thinking of how i would love to jump out the window and end it all just to be over with itand knowing that im going to go home just to sleep another  hours just so i dont have to think about the depressing day ill have tomorrow and knowing that i have nothing left that i like that i have no motivation i dont even care about the money anymore ive had to drop out of university and leave the one last thing i loved doing just so i can afford rent amp to feed myselfso with all that out of the way for the younger ones about to enter the adult life take this advice dont do what you love if you arent working for yourself or for someone that doesnt love what you do theyll always end up stealing it from you and that will make you hate it you will be left with nothing,3.0

54903,stuck in a nutshell there comes a time in every persons life where they experience deaths of a friend family member co worker significant other when you marry someone you intend on spending the rest of your lives together right well my case is different i got engaged at age  married and pregnant at  had my baby at  and my husband passed away when i was  we were married for  months he died in a tragic car accident when my daughter was just  months old i was not only new to motherhood but as a widow as well when he passed away i lost everything he was the man of the house and brought the income into the house he was a great husband and father i did not start moving on until  months after my husbands passing dont get me wrong i slept around a lot but im  nowjust recently i started dating again my new man has been wonderful knowing everything that has happened hes a wonderful boyfriend and hope one day father to my daughter lately i have been feeling depressed and moody constantly i feel alone because i dont think i ever cared for my mental health after my husband died i have talked to councilors a week after my husband died but i just hated talking about my feelings and everything today i stepped up to the plate and recognized i need mental help i finally got the guts to go to the councilor and talk it helped a little bit i am worried that i might lose my new man because i am constantly unhappy  it has nothing to do with him im just finally able to talk about my feelings after holding them in for the last year his one year was feb  it was a good day my boyfriend took off work for me and my daughter so he could support me and my family which is so amazing and thoughtful we went to the aquarium furthermore as the days have passed i have been seeing things lately that arent there and i blame myself for everything i love my daughter but i feel guilty that her dad isnt here it wasnt my fault for her dads passing but i wish i couldve prevented it and forced him to stay home but im trying to move forward and state the fact that its okay to not be okay i just dont want to drag my man  down with me because im still going through grief i hide my grief very well by sex weednot anymore binge eating and such my man has noticed it and has confronted me about it and wants me to express and communicate with him about my feelings but it is so hard because i have not fully understanding myself as a person and i dont want him to think im a lunatic or anything like that but he is so understanding that it scares me he loves me and my daughter which is amazing but it feels too good to be true i dont want my feelings of sadness and anger being him down because i care about his mental health wellness as well god i love this man so much but its scary i say scary because i have so much deep feelings for him and care towards him that my love might be too much for him does that make sense what should i do should i see a psychiatrist,3.0

55139,dont want to live but dont want to die background  maybe the title sounds really confusing or maybe it sounds really clear either way i will explain what i mean i guess im one of those cliche kids that grew up very smart and vibrant but soon became too selfaware of society and emotions in general i think i know too much about things for my own good sometimes i wish i wasnt as aware of the horrors of the real word and everything that comes with it ever since the start of the highschool i have had social anxiety sure i have some friends and such but i feel so awkward in pretty much every social situation my communication skills are alright i guess i think i care too much about what people think and it hurts me a lot anyway as my social anxiety has ramped up through high school so has my anxiety in general i get worried pretty much everything it could be math or chemistry homework that should only take  minutes to do thats my anxiety going i think im a relatively good academic student and ive always held myself to a relatively high standard of work ethic the problem is im a major procrastinator and mentally it always comes back to bite me i always get work in on time but its usually because im working on it for  hours the night before i cant force myself to get out of this habit and it takes a toll on my sleep schedule and in return my mental state the next day sometimes if its a major project or big test i have mental breakdowns i just break down and cry or feel mentally numb to a point where i question why am i even doing this i dont just mean the work i mean everything why am i here what purpose do i have do i even have a future what if im doing all this work and killing my mental state just to end up a failure anyway this is where the depression sets in as fore mentioned i think im too selfaware for my own good nearly everyday i think about who im going be and whats going to happen once im done high school i question my purpose and if ill ever have a impact on society will i ever be loved by someone other than my family why cant i just feel happiness for once when i actually care about my emotions i know people can have a bad day week month or even year but i think having a bad  is more so unfortunate events happen that hurt your feelings and you i dont have those circumstances its just pure chaos in my mind  i suffer to wake up in the morning and go to school it aches me to go to school and act like i like everyone around me i put on a fake smile everyday just to please others why cant i ever show who i truly am to my only friends i am merely a joke surely we chat about our hobbies but they treat me as a puppet when they want to laugh they hit me in my most vulnerable spot being put in an awkward situation they realize how i am in situations like this and purposely do it to get a reaction out of me it sucks but if i didnt have them id have no one to talk to in school and i think that would hurt even more i have been slowly moving away from there and trying to become closer with some of my classmates but its still so tough because im stuck in the middle i have no one to turn to for mental health because im not close enough to either group i dont know if ever in my entire life i have had a friend i could turn to for emotional support online i have some friends who offer great emotional support but i feel like its not a good thing my online emotional support is from people who dont know who i truly am when you have no one to turn to for help it makes you want to end it all ive always told myself even if i suicidal thoughts that i will never kill myself because i know how much it would hurt my family and i dont want to hurt those who felt like they couldve done something to prevent it not to mention i dont have guts to put myself through that type of physical pain i dont think i ever will therefore i want to live but i also want to be put out of misery what do i do tldr  depression has ruined my life im too scared of the circumstances that could happen to those around me if i committed suicide but i also dont want to suffer any longer what should i do ,3.0

55315,i basically have no life and finding it difficult to enjoy it fully i am an  year old freshman doing a course in general science with modules in physics and astrophysics biology mathematics for scientists and geology having started university back in september i have aspergers syndrome but this only stopped heavily affecting me when i was about  having been stuck in a constant routine of getting up at  in the morning catch my bus at  so i wont miss or be late for my  or  lectures almost every day of the week then call it a day by  usually  really sucks the energy out of me honestlyif thats not enough ive been struggling to get on top of my studies if thats all ive been doing for the past five or six months or so it really becomes a life sucker really trying to actually know my content because i tend to forget things easily i only got in my course because of my special disability meaning i am quite behind other students who took it harder to get in so i constantly end up comparing myself to other students seeing how hard and organized they are working yet able to have a life and go out late nights to regular social society events nightclubs and regular outings at the bar while im finding it hard to break out of my social awkwardness make some friends that arent pretentious fit in with the crowd and not have negative subconscious thoughts all the timewhen i was in high school i used to be one of the smartest in my yeargrade until i nearly flunked my finals because i burned out the last two months and wasted it binge messaging on social media such as discord so i knew i should have had it coming until i finally did get accepted in uni anywaybut nonetheless im struggling and still paying the price my lab tutors expect a lot more from me even though i worked countless hours on those reports they give the impression judging from their comments on it that it was shit so i feel dumb honestly and makes me contemplate my life and everything i strived to work fori missed the simpler times in school and i enjoyed the subject before i picked it in uni i dont know why i didnt expect anything else beforehand but i am youngits just the fact that i cant make time to do anything and find time to find out what i actually want be it a hobby or whatever when the only thing ive got on my plate is constant studying and talking with family playing videogames only on the rare occasion and watching movies it all just feels bland and so i have nothing interesting going on nothing to talk about or contribute to the crowd and fit in with other people who are able to integrate many aspects in their lives yet still get on top of their grades and studies judging by how i observe them answering the lecturers questions in the lecture leaving me amazed honestly another thing most other people are more confident able to talk to girls properly seem organized in their life when mine is just a clusterfuck of getting things done which is pretty much pure nothing if i was able to describe what i do for a living with someone honestly it is what it is ive been watching tons of motivational videos and trying to find areas in which cause happiness and how to achieve that ive joined many societies at my college but never been to events regularly because of the overwhelming work at college so i just never have time maybe that imbalance just fucks me up because thats the time ill probably never get back i just wish life would be easier i would stop being a cityfolk and go live in some countryside probably holed up in some cabin in the middle of the woods and actually start engaging with whatever im doing likely behind a typewriter and no timewasting social media like twitter or discord what i spend most of my time on or whatever and a cup of hot coffee beside me i just dont have enough of a personality to be deserving in peoples social group what am i to them i pretty much have no shadowid love to hear some advice though and people to hear me out ive been wanting to let this out of my chest for a while possibly years but i just think noone in real life would take me as seriously because they wouldnt understand unfortunately studying is the life if i want to secure a decent job with an amazing paygrade if medical physicist is what id want to be its been my idea since my middle years in high school i guess but even then im still not sure now if im making a mistakewhich is why i feel my life is in shambles that im following blindly,3.0

55597,how to ask for help i definitely need help ive been through so much especially for my age i know thats probably something a lot of people say but honestly im tired of it ive lost more people than i can count and im not even  yet ive had anxiety for about a year and a half and i remember the exact day it started somebody i knew had died we werent too close but for some reason when i found out it happened it was like a switch turned on inside me and it hasnt gone off since so for  days ive lived with my anxiety i havent had a panic attack in a while and honestly i think its because i dont care enough about anything to actually trigger one some days are better than others ive learned to live with it but its always there and coupled with the depression i always say i dont have and it hurts every time someone ask me are you depressed because i always say no because i dont know how to say yes for some reason my mind wont let me ask for help its like whenever i wanna try my anxiety convinces me not too its painful to think about a life without any of this being able to go out without this weight on me one of my friends said that since he started consistently taking his anti depressants that he feels so much better and that he had felt this way since he was  which got me wondering as to what its actually like to be able to be happy for once occasionally ill have a good day or moment but then its gone the day ends or the moments over and in the end i realize im alone honestly i know i need help i just really dont know how to ask for it but for some reason my instinct is rather than actually go out and ask for help is to drink smoke cigarettes and weed because for some reason i feel like this will help me in some way which it doesnt when i drink by myself which is always i just feel even sadder but i keep going back to these habits because i feel like its the only way to help myself which i know its not honestly i just want this pain to be gone im tired of being sad anxious and just unable to connect with people i never talk to people about my issues rather cover it up with jokes or memes hoping someone will catch onto this they never do i have plenty of friends and i love them all i just dont know how to say it its so hard for me to say those  words i love you i wanna show my friends i care but my anxiety wont let me it tells me not too that it wouldnt be right so i dont one time my friend saw my wrist and asked me what it was and i responded with cat thats it no story or anything just cat she didnt believe it shes really the only whos seen my wrist like that whenever i do anything i always keep my hoodie on with my sleeves down until he heals anyway ive never gone deep enough to have blood flow from my wrist but every time i do i feel like im getting closer i dont even know why i do it i just think thisll help it doesnt maybe someone will see my wrist theyll help me but that never happens because i hide it i hide my depression anxiety and cuts all because i dont know how to ask for help,3.0

55641,i really need some support  hey so basically ive been seeing a therapist on and off since i was nine i have been diagnosed with ocd and situational depression that psychiatrists have said could easily lead to severe chronic depression i went from being extremely social and motivated to be the best to barely finding the motivation to shower more than twice a week my parents think i am just lazy and blame the change its been about four months of this on my phone and it hurts because i really am trying but i have an extreme lack of motivation for things like my social life or school ive only realized this year that i am depressed but looking back on my childhood i believe i grew up depressed my parents dont get along at all and raised me by manipulating me with guilt and by invalidating my emotions i believe my parents are emotionally abusive bc from a young age whenever id mess up theyd guilt me by looming their deaths over my head or by isolating me from the rest of the world and putting it behind the facade of protection my parents have already turned off my phone from  and they turn  off the wifi at  every night so i am forced to wallow in my hopelessness and they shame me for being too emotional but at this point crying is all i know my parents have always openly fought in front of me and blamed me for causing whatever they would be fighting about they sarcastically tell me how optimistic or fun to hang out with i am whenever i try to open up to them and claim i will make them depressed as an excuse to ignore my revelations they refuse to let me go on any medication and have grounded me for the next month bc i had a panic attack after the ridiculed me and threatened to go to my teachers after i opened up to them there is a huge history of substance abuse in my family and im afraid i might be going down that road i fully understand that i can be difficult but i just really need some ensight or a little motivation right now after crying also they accuse me of faking my depression for attention and lying and being grounded is my punishment for that thanks,3.0

55814,and now i see my life as the banal slog it has instantly become tame impalas past life it resonated with me so much i started to tear up im often happy and have good days but my life seems to have general theme of uneasiness like this is it work home work home work etc it would probably improve if i got a job in what i actually went to college for in engineering design amp drafting but finding one and wading through the x years experience required and other bullshit submitting all the resumes and then getting maybe one interview in which they appreciate my interest but move on with more qualified candidates would fuck me up even more my friends and family so i could be doing so much more with my life in a nice way im really passionate about science and philosophy but despite many attempts ive failed make use of that so far to pay the bills doing something i love it would seem i have all of the ideas none of the motivation can tell you the distance to alpha centauri offhand but not consistently get up on time for work in fast food what the fucki suppose it may just be the scientistphilosopher curse always trying to think up solutions to inexplicable problems when i should just try to make the most of my life instead i more or less drag myself through most the time just waiting to be off work and waiting for the weekend then dreading the week even though its really not that bad i have friends there and the majority of the people in the world have it worse than me and yet im just sloggin my way through day after daythat said i am grateful to have loving friends and experiences to create good memories i think the problem is mostly internal and comes in waves the majority of the time i dont feel depressed although theres always an undercurrent of uneasiness like is this it i was brought into existence for this also i am trying to better my mental health and circumstances with mindfulness meditation and i was trying the wim hof method well see how it goes anyways wishing you good sleep and peace of mind all the best,3.0

55821,one question sorry for the length what do you dohow should you think when you key word gt believe that you almost completely understand your depression by that i mean for me personally that i understand that im depressed and there may be more underlying issues that i fail to recognize yet i actively choose to do nothing about it it might be is also important to know  that ive never been professionally diagnosed with depression nonetheless i still know which steps i need to take to get better i also know that a lot of things just take time to come to terms with im very aware of how i can get better and even so i consciously choose to do nothing in fact i pretty much play into it on purpose ive become addicted to it in a sense i lay in bed for at the very least  hours a day and succumb to at least  of my negative thoughts i know that lack of motivation is a symptom of depression and ive overcome it in the past its been rearing its ugly head again but this time i just choose to pick my battles with it it wins almost every time i realize there are a lot of details ive refrained from sharing that would help you understand my situation but for me i feel its unimportant when it comes to dealing with these thoughts inside your own head regardless of any one persons situation in life its more than possible to succumb to these feelings were all human which inadvertently leads me to a transition ive been struggling to make in regards to myself which is that i love life i love how unexpected life is and i love the nature of living and everything that this world has to offer yet for some reason  of the time i dont want to be here ive been thinking about death and dying every day for the past month or two no concrete plans to do so but its still been on my mind so i guess thats why i ask my original question and in addition to that question ill ask one more what keeps you alive aside from answers like family and friends what is the selfish reason you keep yourself heresorry for the length and if you took the time to read it all i truly appreciate you thank you for listening,3.0

56168,its a tough mental health day today im not sure why im here i shouldnt be considering how good my life is i have two kids  and  a wife that i have an amazing relationship with a great job with a good salary all things point to be happy dude but i find myself all too often where im at tonight a seemingly empty area of loneliness i have no friends so i have zero people to confide these thoughts to so ive decided tonight that from a somewhat anonymous account thatll ill confide in redditso im laying in my bed atm next to my wife that ive had the pleasure of knowing since i was   now we have nearly zero marital problems nearly because we all have nitpicks about our so wed like to change but for all intents and purposes shes perfect she gave birth to our two beautiful children she makes our house a home two months ago i started a new job that increased my salary  i finally made it i thought i bought s new motorcycle a few weeks ago i felt like that was going to be a mental escape similar to they way video games are butmore real gym time every morning pulls these feelings away for the hour and half im there so thats nice but fleetingi say all these things because even with all of this i still feel alone constantly i feel like everything i do is mundane i work from home so im in this bubble as well mostly alone with myself my new job is great and while i know my job well im constantly feeling like im the least intelligent person here and one day theyll realize im a fraud and fire me thats a constant fear i think part of that stems because im self taught in my field and these folks are highly educated as far as friends i have none ive attempted to make friends but its just alwaysawkward i cant find anyone interesting enough to feel urge to engage with them no one reaches out to engage with me either so i suppose thats a mutual feeling thisweight has begun to kinda screw with me im not finding joy and fun in video games any longer im less interested to interact with my family i dont care about self educating with work like i normally would be i feel like my brain is wasting too much energy focusing on these feelings and emotions and its clogging up the pipeline i find myself looking at what ive written and its a bit of a mess in just writing what comes to mind i  cant really articulate the feeling its more an aura than a feeling its odd ,3.0

56301,stuck in a cycle hi everyone im just trying to get some stuff off my chest and dont really know what to do quick background and a minor rant i have an  month old daughter and am stuck in a career path that i hate before she was born i wound up in this field because i was a very immature student and didnt finish my degree then when i tried to get into a trade i got stuck behind others who themselves werent passing school so they wouldnt indenture until the other apprentices moved up which non did for two years i made the mistake of disclosing a medical condition to my boss and months later i got moved to a different field i hated it but it was secure although at that company it felt like i was working for free then she came since then ive been in a depression where i feel like a bad parent and husband because i make less than i know im capable of i got a job in the same line of work closer to home so im here an extra two hours a day and making a little more money but i still havent shaken those feelings off there isnt any worse feeling that holding you child and wanting to cry because you feel like youve let her down already i feel directionless and hopeless,3.0

56713,a terribly long rant im sorry if you read this i just dont have anyone to really rant to i wish i had a friend that i could talk to with no worries someone to share my thoughts comfortably i have  friends that i still speak with occasionally but its not the same  moved to outer state colleges and the other is always busy with their life school and worketc  its just how life is how eventually everyone you met in high school go their separate ways and find their own new friends and such and i feel as if i am stuck and not moving forward i feel as if i am left behind as i watch others move on i miss having someone to talk to whenever but i worry that i burden them or annoy them and it sucks i struggle socially but i try to make an effort to make friends in college and when i do manage to make a few friends they dont seem interested in actually being anything more than a peer to get hw answers from i sometimes hated myself for being an asian because i feel like people only get close to me just to benefit last semester was awfully terrible for me mentally i was nervous about being able to make friends and i had transferred from uni to a community college for financial reasons i was super happy that i managed to get to know my peers in  of my classes everything was going well and i was actually looking forward to this entire semester but i began to notice something off in one class one would text me for hw answers and i was totally fine with giving and eventually theyd miss a day or two from class and ask for updates i thought i was overthinking things and ignored them but then id notice how almost everytime theyd ask for hw answers but never return the favor another would deliberately try to make me look dumb in front of the prof theyd ask me a question about the assignment and i would reply honestly that i didnt know the answer to and that they should ask the professor for clarification and when they do theyd turn to me and exclaim see i told you so the first time they did that i was so confused as to what they told me then id notice how almost every class period we had theyd do the same thing over again i hated it im a nice person and im not the kind to talk back so id just sit thereand take it i guess it was mentally draining and i hated going to the class whenever they do it i felt everyones eyes stare through me and i felt so uncomfortable the third person on my table mostly kept to themselves and would occasionally ask for helpbut they too would have a remark or two about how smart i was and that i got everything handled she made it seemed as if i was such a genius that everything came easy and shed laugh it off as a joke it was suffocating i shifted my focus on my schoolwork and made perfect marks on my exams and whenever the prof handed the test papers for us to see i could tell they were jealous and it seeped off them i could feel it wed all compare our exams and theyd be annoyed that they couldnt get an a even though they studied a lot and i was shocked i even made perfect marks on the exam because ive never done that my entire life i truly felt the exam was difficult and it was exhausting spending hours and hours studying and i would tell them all of that and theyd reply with a sarcastic remark eventually id stop giving out my opinions about the exams whenever theyd ask the class wasnt difficult because it was mostly memorizing i always felt super guilty about my exam grades because i felt that i shouldve helped them study as the school semester went by the worse it got and i just shut myself off but im too nice to ignore them so everytime i see them i would smile and remain quiet i kept myself busy with classwork to avoid talking to them it was so mentally exhausting i felt bad about the entire semester and id beat myself up over it i thought to myself that maybe if i communicated better none of this wouldve happened almost everyday that i had to wake up for that class was extremely hard every morning was exhausting no matter how many hours of sleep i had i didnt want to get out of bed and i had to force myself out and as soon as class started id want it to be over with in another class the person that sat next to me was chill and nice as i thought there wasnt need to really talk to each other except group work i ended up having to do all of the group work and present the groupwork myself while they stood there i was awfully furious about it but i didnt want to confront them about it or email the prof about it because they werent doing well in class and i felt bad towards the end of the semester theyd text me and ask me to help them on the exam which i refused because i told them i havent studied for the exam due to the fact that i had  other exams going on same day and in that class one low exam score was allowed to be dropped and i told them that i chose this exam to be a drop grade and theyd reply with im sure youll do well even though you didnt studied likeok and when i didnt help them out they eventually moved seats next to another person which i was totally fine withsometimes i wish i was more confident in myself and others i blame myself for things like this happening to me because i allow it i have no control over it but at the same time i do in a way i fear this semester may be the same and i dread it,3.0

56758,i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should post it here or in rsuicidal but oh boy here we go                  so im a  year old guy currently living in italy and my entire life has consisted on me being pathetic and weak always disinterested on what you folks would consider normal and whatnot                       id say that it all started when my family and i moved in this country back in  when i was still  years old which led me on a social isolation because i had no ducking clue about what language they were speaking and because my parents were uptight about us passing a goddammed minute outside our house so my routine pretty much consisted on going to school then back at home i mean what could possibly go wrong certainly the fucking kid will never be fucking awkward right   well surprise surprise what a fucking plot twist the kid became so fucking awkward that he grew knowing nothing of what a social interaction is                         i pretty much wasnt the best student in the class not because im stupid or anything i just wasnt interested                  then boom im suddenly the most messed up guy in the whole goddamed universe                                                                oh did i forgot to mention that im gay fucking la di da i think im seeing a pattern here universe oh it looks like you fucking hate me universe                       moving on alle scuole superiori im not sure if its college ing english i pretty much just wasted  years of my goddamed life before one of my teachers helped me change course to something more interesting i thought to myself hey you got another chance man dont wast it up i actually tried my goddamed best to better myself and surprisingly i actually did i even made lots of friends mostly girls but still i actually thought for once that maybe my life will turn for the better now           well it seems like the universe saw how much better i was doing so it fucking decided to beat the crap out of my life because oh boy what the hell just happened                                                            theres this one guy that i really liked for some reason i mean every goddamed day he used to playfully insult  me in class for a whole fucking year i took it but you know what it wasnt enough for him that i almost cried most of the time because of how it hurts no he had to top it somehow but how oh i know how about a public bus so as we entered the bus filled with people we chose to stand in a spot and guess what happened he started toplayfully insult me belittling every thing about me telling me how pathetic i was he probably was right because i still remained his friend but he actually treated me better probably because i stopped holding my emotion and i just cried in front of my class more than once like how pathetic am i right                                                                       another reason for my emotional outbursts is probably my friends part of my female friends the ones that i thought liked me turns out that they despised me they just didnt care even if i was sitting in front of them in the middle of a lecture no they always fucking repeat talking shit about me everyday till i just couldnt do it any longer                                                                     well it seems like that the universe was finding it really amusing being gay wasnt enough nonono the universe being lovely as it is gave me depression turns out depression hits you like a motherfucking truck filled with explosives obviously                                it pretty much led me thinking about killing my pathetic self every single day to this fucking day and listening to sad music doesnt really help                               i dont believe in god or anything like that but if there is one i just want to ask him what did i do to deserve all these crap in my life just why is it like a punishment for something terrible i did in another life is this my hell my very special hell where ill just suffer every single day of my pathetic life i seriously dont know anymore i tried killing myself with a knife but every single time that i try to i stop myself because havent i suffered enough or is this what you planned for me,3.0

56890,my description of what depression is like heres the analogy i use when describing it to a nondepressed personimagine that you have to move yourself from point a to point b  feet away for a normal person they just stand up and walk across the ground for the fifty feet and theyre done very simplewhen youre depressed the task is the same but its not solid ground its loose wet mud that you sink into up to your knees and its completely surrounding you to move you have to lift your leg up so high as to get it completely out of the mud then plant it back into the mud somewhere in the direction that you want to go then repeat until you get theresometimes you fall down and get covered by the mudwhich sucks because you dont want to look like youve been traipsing through the mud but your legs are already covered in it anywayits not that your destination is that far away its that the effort involved to do even the simple act of trying to get there is exceptionally draining you can still get there but its slow and exhaustingto top it offwhen you actually arrive at your destination youre still covered in mudwhat antidepressants do in this context is lay down planks over the mud for you to walk on you get where youre going with a lot less effort and a lot more speed you can focus on doing the thing you meant to do once you get there instead of on the act of getting there it wont guarantee that youll be completely mud free and you can still fall off the planks right back into the mudbut its better than no planks at allsource personal experience as a depressed person,3.0

56935,why im sad  at the moment  i am leaving for my second semester of college and tomorrow i will have to move all of my stuff into a new dorm which i will share with a girl i have never met before my experience with random roommates last semester was probably the worst time of my life i was not comfortable or happy there and i fear that this situation will turn out the same way i am upset that i will be away from my cats i already miss them and it would kill me if anything happened to either one of them while i am away because their lives are far more important than my schooling i will miss my family even though they may sometimes be the source of my sadness my mother is the only one i can confide in and even though i can call her it is not the same as having her by my side at college i have real responsibilities i have to go ro classes for a large portion of the day and while i am not in classes i have to do homework andor study although i want to do well in school i have no motivation to complete my work to the best of my ability i am not confident in my current major but there is nothing else that interests me and i fear failure i am disappointed in my inability to make new friends or put myself out there at all i do not speak up in class or talk to many people for fear of judgement which is weird because in my mind i dont particularly care what people think about me    as a whole  for the last few years maybe  i havent felt like im myself though i dont even really know what that means anymore i have trouble connecting with others even if i truly want to deep down i havent had a best friend in around   years which has severely impacted me i feel alone and unlikable ive never been in a relationship or even held hands with another personpeople try to get to know me but i simply shut them down i think this is because i am scared that i wont be enough for them i hate that i am this way i wish i was carefree and confident but instead i am insecure and anxious this is reflected in my voice which is unusually monotone according to many people i know or have known maybe this makes me seem standoffish a few previous friends of mine have told me that i intimidated them at first which is the last way id like to come across it baffles me that i a   year old girl with a baby face could intimate anyone but i apparently defy all odds i dont know if im going down the right path in life or not i feel lost many days i just wish i could disappear off the face of the planet because of how utterly hopeless i feel and how negative my outlook of the future is i feel that even if i successfully graduate with my degree and make a large amount of money annually i will not be happy however i dont know what else i could be doing at the moment to endure my future happiness so in my mind its better to be unhappy with a degree and a lucrative career rather than be unhappy with nothing to my name even though it doesnt really make a difference for the past few years i have suspected that i have depression but my own self doubt keeps me from doing anything about it my problems seem small to me even though i am deeply unhappy i always think that even if i did go to a therapist for a diagnosis i would have no idea how to explain why i am sad and i guess thats why i am writing this to find out why i am sad i feel that my case is not serious enough because i have never had serious suicidal thoughts and the closest thing to selfharm ive ever experienced is punching myself on my thighs or arms i also have trouble confiding in others in general so i dont know how therapy could ever work for me additionally i dont want to put a financial burden on my parents to see a therapist i just keep hoping that this will go away on its own but it hasnt so far the only things i ever feel like doing are watching twitch tv shows or playing videogames my sleep schedule is in shambles i either sleep too much or too little i want to be proud of myself i want to feel passionate about something but theres nothing it annoys me when people assume i must be smart or very accomplished to be an engineering major and a spanish minor because i am not satisfied with where i am i did well in high school but not well enough to go to the college i hoped to go to i cant even transfer to it because i have zero accomplishments and the minimum required gpa for transfers is a  while i have a  thats dwindling and even if i could i would feel inadequate compared to classmates who got in the first time and would likely be a year ahead of me im just unhappy with every aspect of my life i know i have no right to be i am very privileged to be where i am right now and many people would kill to be in my position but im still deeply sad and unfulfilled,3.0

57010,i did some self reflecting and reminded myself of all the things ive learned unlearned and am proud of myself for even if in everyday life i overlook these qualities in myself they are still good  we put so much pressure on ourselves and overthink so much we forget about who we really are after having somewhat of a breakdown being very anxious i got deep in thought about how i am not the things that happened to me but that i have learned so much i dont give myself the credit for sometimes we get and are stuck in a depressive state because we gave no confidence in ourselvesand we paint a picture of ourselves as our problems or the unfortunate events weve experienced i decided to write a letter to myself about what i am proud of what ive learned from my mistakes what good qualities ive kept despite going through hell and what i hope to discover about myself in the future its really helped me have a more confident calmer gentler way of seeing myself i am only human its ok to not be okay but its not okay to think you are garbage because of the stuff thats happened,3.0
57011,im a new mom and i want to end it all dear people of reddit im planning on killing myself today for a little bit of context the man i had this baby with we were together for about three years were not together anymore i am asexual which means i dont enjoy sex in any way shape or form my ex oftentimes would force himself on me but on this rare occasion when my daughter was conceived i did agree to have sex with him however he came in me without my consent im not really sure if youd label that as rape or what all i know is that its wrong im  now hes  ive gone through a lot with this man and even though my family is absolutely in love with my daughter my parents especially theyre in their  now and poor as hell and i cant help but feel that by having my daughter i placed a financial burden on their shoulders even though they would never say it i know that i did the worst part is there was nothing that i could do to stop it throughout my whole pregnancy i was forced to watch my body distort and change into something i never wanted it to i never wanted any children i also cant help but feel like my ex forced me into this position as if to say hahaha now you cant get rid of me i was having issues with him before my daughter was conceived im also having problems with his family his family harassed me for over a year they did all sorts of things to me including forcing me to stay outside in freezing cold weather with nothing but a bathrobe on and no shoes for over an hour now im scared that one of these days those racist morons are going to find my daughter or at least find out about her because of everything that i went through with that family im afraid for her safety overall i just want the pain to stop every time i look at my daughter i cant help but feel like i was taken advantage of like the role of mother was forced upon me something that i never wanted to be i was forced into even though my tubes are completely severed i still cant help but feel this way irrational thoughts that flud my mind that say all anyone was ever born to do is to reproduce and die so goes on to the next generation and it worries me that i have a daughter it scares me to think that some day the same will happen to her and i dont want to be around to see that happen to her it absolutely infuriates me that evolution has left women with such a disadvantage because unlike men women dont have the option to pull out women cant just check a box and say i dont want to have kids we have no choice in the matter ultimately as a woman it doesnt matter what you want all that matters is what your body wants i cant take this anymore i just want to end it all maybe in the next life ill be lucky and ill come back as a man at least then ill have an option  i hope i do,3.0

57013,the big d i have been thinking a lot about depression and being depressed the big d is like a death penalty you can try to act like it isnt there or real but it always comes back into your head that you are in this shitty situationi have been trying for almost a year now to better myself because i always thought that i made myself depressed so i tried to workout have a better attitude about nearly everything in life to be greatful when i think about how greatful i should be i get even more deeper into that empty dark feeling because i start to feel pitty for all those who have it even worse doesnt matter who if i think about a child somewhere that is molested hungry or sleeping in the cold and how i am pretty well off in comparison to them i feel so ashamed and so sad if i workout it numbs me completely i find myself cycling or running all the time and thinking almost too deep even when i am listening to podcasts or audiobooks it distances me even more from the world the worst is when people ask me what is wrong with me what should i answer they act like they care or they tell themselves they care but in reality nobody wants you at yor worst not even your family for me family was what triggered depression it is so hard to put in words what it is and how it feels i know that for everyone it feels a bit different i really do understand people who think about suicide i totally get it now i dont even want to take my life but i wouldnt mind if someone would shoot me while i am doing my run in the forest or if someone accedentally would run me over with a car i just wouldnt want that person to feel awful for it or go to prison whatevever  if i would tell anybody this in my real world they would ridicule me or tell me how i am overreacting or say those awfull things like we can talk about it as much as you want i am here for you i dont want to anymore the worst part about the big d is that in your heart you know that it wont get better or at least you can not see it,3.0

57033,my life is nothing i started feeling this way during high school im tipsy right now so ill try my best here i had a tight knit group of friends in elementary who i enjoyed being around but they all ended up taking academic classes while i took applied classes because im kind of dumb and also was not willing to put any effort into high school this is now a regret because i spent most of my time in high school around people i didnt really like while all my friends were having a blast with each otherthis led to issues because since i never talked in most of my classes i never learned how to socialize properly and its destroying me i can be pretty confident at times but as soon as someone tries to initiate a conversation i freeze up and start giving one word answers leading the conversation nowheremy social issues have also ruined any good chance at a relationship one of the girls i work with who also used to go to my high school showed a lot of interest in me but since i was always awkward and couldnt give more than a yes or no at most times it ended up going nowhere even though i was also interested in herthis makes me upset because i am a  year old virgin and all i really want right now is a girlfriend i can spend time with im not even worried about losing my virginity at this point i just want someone i could be close with and spend a bunch of time with so im not so lonely all the timeloneliness is another huge problem in my life i only have  close friends and we try to hang out whenever we can the issue is  of those friends are a couple and the other  used to be in a relationship but split up though they occasionally hook up still it bugs me because i feel like i may spend my life alone because i cannot connect with anyone while everyone around me are in relationshipsdespite all of that i still enjoy all the time we spend together however its not often as they all either work or are in school so we can rarely find times where we are all available i used to love playing games online when i was in elementary because i got to talk to  whole bunch of new people but my anxiety i have today prevents that from happening anymore i would feel much better if i had some close friends i could play with online but im no longer able to do that because i dont feel comfortable talking to people anymorei tried doing shrooms once to see if that could help my depression but of course i put way too much faith into that and it ended up doing nothing even though i enjoyed the experience while it lasted as i felt as though i had no care in the world for a few hoursalcohol also doesnt work as well as it used to when it comes to socializing two years ago i could get drunk and have a decent time at parties but now being drunk doesnt help me at all as i only get more worried about what everyone thinks of me out of a fear that ill make an ass of myself somehowi dont get out much i work about  hours a week at a part time job even though i hate it there and my friends are more often then not busy so i cant be with them i try to use video games as an escape but they dont work as well as they used to years agosorry for the ranty post that went nowhere this is all something ive wanted to get off my chest for a long time but i never felt like i could until now feel free to comment or ask any questions and ill try to get to them when i wake up thank you for reading,3.0

57036,eureka i hope this helps someone other than just myself i think i may have stumbled on an idea of the function of panic and anxiety is first introduced to our brain functions and the reason behind why i think depression is a by product of these circumstances  it struck me as i woke up this morning in my haziness of waking slumber  i spent the last  hours trying to put it into wordslet me start by being clear im no medical expert  this hypothesis is solely based on observations of personal experiences for nearly  decades  nothing that what im proposing here is based on any medical study or expertise just shooting from the hip here  here goesi think panic and anxiety are anatomical responses to the advent of the notion of social usefulness and the never ending constantly growing need to prove personal usefulness to self and others around depression is the neurological attempt at assimilation and adaptation to these constant stresses in response  my idea is that as an animal humans werent developed to live life in high stress situations  anxiety building to panic is a primitive survival function  when we were living in the wild we remember sounds that belonged to things that may cause us bodily harm  roars thunder fast flowing water etc this caused us to fight of flee the  primary responses to a threat  once that threat was neutralized or gotten away from the anxiety would subside and life could go on naturally only needing to obtain food and shelter we also instinctually seek other interactions like procreative instincts and desire but those usually come secondary to basic survival needs  dread is the mental response to not being able to fight that threat or flee from it  depression happens when we dont know what the threat is and uncertainty of our ability to escape it  essentially we are just experiencing and influencing our environment our use was simply to survive as long as possiblewe have to first identify the traits of the human as an animal  what is the basic primary functions of a human animal in the wild  we have a relative  of our lifetime already set in rhythm for sleep that functions as an energy recharge and the time your body repairs itself and grows the most  the rest of the day was spent primarily seeking survival mechanisms  food shelter something to cover our fragile skin to protect it from the elements  that could be several things from mud animal hides primitive weaved fabrics from leaves etc  the daily activities and functions needed for human survival were relatively basic and minimal  and most of the advancements in technology minus militarywarfare has been to better provide for ourselves the basic things necessary up until we had relatively mechanized survival  this happened at about the industrial revolution in the late s  at this point industrial manufacturing of our survival tools began to grow and quickly most of our needs began being met by industry grocery stores shops for clothes home building subdivisions gas and electric companies hospitals etc  industry gave way to the military industrial complex and global military became the biggest industry on the planet  this is in part what facilitated  and all wars since then and those wars gave people something to feel useful about  useful to their communities useful to their countries useful to their friends and peers they were fighting alongside  this was a manipulation of preconceived notions of nationalism as a method of social influence  this is still a mechanism that is pushed today  fast forward to the s just after  and in the united states the outlook was one of a new golden age  everything was possible and outlooks were positive  many still refer to this stereotype as the good ole days  this gave rise to an economic boom of people wanting to obtain the possessions that provided a solid secure life  a home a car financial abundance all the things we consider today to be key markers in what delegates a persons basic achievements in life was the primary social pursuit  take care of yourself clothe yourself feed yourself etc  most of us would all agree that this should be a relative standard amongst the general population although that isnt always the case  this massive influx of this demand for these possessions along with new growth in population baby boomer generation led to increasing demand for industrial manufactured goods  since these goods had manufacturers suggested retail value this also leads to a higher overhead needed per household  higher over head demands a higher wage  higher wage is proposed to be obtained by a higher skill set  so this opened up opportunity to industrial education  this available education then lead to an increasing standard in what is expected of the general person in oder to signify to themselves and the people around them that they are indeed successful enough to take care of their basic needs  this outlook has lead to the global measure of success primarily being determined by bankroll education level and professional status  all of which are determined to a certain degree by the amount of effort you out into achieving financial and educational milestones as well as your proficiency in achieving them  but one cannot argue the a lot of it is also based on chance occurrences  for example certain opportunity is obtained by simply meeting and interacting with people  often people gain access to career opportunity simply by knowing someone they were friends with in college or some other social interaction  these friendships are often treated as if they have more value than others  if you achieve these goals in the top percentages of proficiency and happen to know just the right people you are deemed the most useful therefore the most in demand in your particular expertise  this goal is to obtain the best chance at obtaining the most wage to work hour ratio  to produce as much assets as possible to sustain the personal survival needs of you and any group you choose to provide for family etc this finally creates an atmosphere in which you must toil to create the most demand for yourself your skills and whatever else you can offer that is useful to someone else that determines whether you become one of  things a social asset or a social liability  this constant atmosphere leads to an unusual set of conditions which lead from anxiety to panic to depression and ultimately to dreadhopelessnessmy goal of writing this all down and sharing it is to hopefully give myself and other a better hypothetical outlook on understanding the nature of these emotional and mental states so that i can better cope with them in the moment of experience  hopefully this can alleviate some of the whats wrong with me and will i always be like this feeling when these episodes occur by my remembering that this is just a neurochemical response to an unnatural situation that i am coping with applying scientific observation to instinctive traits that will enable me to have a better chance at my basic human function survivalbe gentle to yourself  for better or worse we live in a mechanized civilization and certain achievements are needed in order to live in a modern social environment  but try to remember survival is your only real required use  everything else is just what you choose to do  whether or not you offer something to the world today should not be your only measure of self worth  the fact that we are embodied and aware in an organic vehicle and not only able to interact with but influence our environment and each other is in itself one of the most astounding and undeniably incredible aspect of being a living human being  just that alone is pretty amazingdont let yourself get overwhelmed by what the world is telling you that you should be doing  do what you think you should be doing do what you want to be doing  be in your experience  be in your body in your life  joy and pain are part of what indicates that we are alive and that in itself can be beautiful  im doing my best everyday to not let any of the monsters or shadows in the world ruin my subjective experience as awareness embodied  because ill only be me once  and i want to enjoy this ride as much as i can  i want to love i want to create i want to laugh  thats more important than my survival functions  thats my instinct and applying instinct to intention is an approach that could make us remarkable  be you be free and remember you are useful  you need you to experience this awareness  thats primary  what you do with that experience is who you ultimately become  and remembering that my friends just might be enough to help me get through a tough day  express your awe lift an eye to the cosmos and be in the universe together  we can survive this too  thats what our species does survives,3.0

57055,how do i make sense of what happened i am  now but when i was in highschool i was in a  year relationship with a girl who emotionally abused me and gaslighted me to the point of myself attempting suicide multiple times im not one to get triggered but hearing her name in passing sends me into a spiral the topic recently came up with my longtime boyfriend as i had been pushing it away for years avoiding the topic i dont know how to explain the situation without sounding crazy because it does sound crazy why would i date someone i actively hated for  years why wouldnt i just leave when i realized i was being abused i dont know its because i was being manipulated and threatened that if i left i would be responsible for her suicide its because i was tricked into alienating all my friends so if left i would have nobody left its because when i was still in the hospital after overdosing she continued to tell me how i was selfish i was being its how she told everyone i attempted and then blamed my best friend for the reason the whole student body knew i was gone my closest friend who witnessed it all real time is the only one in the world that truly understands as well as i do what happened and i know she knows why this happened but i dont know how to express the pain to anyone else without sounding like an idiot i dont even know how to explain to myself what happened and if it was all my fault after all,3.0

57102,there is hope this time a year ago i was admitted in to the hospital for the second time for attempting suicide may of last year i was so depressed and my anxiety was so severe that i couldnt take it anymore i hated myself so much and thought it would be better if i wasnt here for the second time my husband called  and forced me into emergency after overdosing i was then transferred to an inpatient facility for mood disorders for the second time i was mad at myself that i was back in there again for god knows how long this time i was devastated i was putting my husband through this pain and stress again he kept telling me that it wasnt my fault and that i was sick and that he was there for me as many times as he told me that it was hard to believe at the time and then something changed i met the most amazing psychiatrist this was the  person psychiatristpsychologisttherapist etc i was seeing some i saw were great some were so awful they shouldnt have their practicing license but number  i wish the world could meet him he worked with me he told me we were a team and together we were going to decide what was best for me he was funny he was patient and he was extremely smart and not just book smart street smart too the way i was able to laugh at everything i was going through made everything seem lighter easier to deal with and something i could actually manage for the first time the world didnt seem so heavy anymore he worked with me on my terms we laughed a lot and i really cant describe how much that helped me figure things out for so long i felt crazy so i felt like my opinions didnt matter or didnt make sense but he told me my opinions were valid and i know me better than anybody and he helped me find me a year later im out of the hospital and thriving im getting back in to doing what i love going on an exciting bucket list adventure next week which i never thought id make it to and back to doing what i love i just want everyone out there to know there is hope and people told me that before and i never believed it trust me keep going to different therapists until you find your person you will get better god damn it takes a lot of work but i promise you it is worth it i can genuinely say i am happy and my husband now has said i always knew you were still in there,3.0

57279,why people with depression feel alone do you know why people with depression say they feel alone all the time even when they have friends family and people who care its because even though physically they arent alone mentally and emotionally they are it doesnt matter how many friends they have at the end of the day when they are suffering and they think wow i wish i wasnt alone right now or i wish i had someone to talk to they check their contacts when they look through the list of names all they see is all the energy they would have to put into confiding in each person for starters that person would have to believe that their friend is depressed they have to listen to them and try to understand what it must feel like to be them then they need to know not to give unsolicited advice and so on   i dont reach out to people for multiple reasons theres no one im close enough to that id feel comfortable with them seeing me like this  im afraid of them not believing me or telling me to be practical or logical i dont wanna hear anything they have to say unless its im here for you i cant imagine how hard this is  i dont have the energy to entertain them or really have fake conversations i just want them to sit next to me thats all so far no one in my life fits any of the above  ive tried talking to friends about my depression before and they dont get it its hard enough to let people in when im good so im sure as hell not gonna do it when im like this i really wish i had just one person id want them to hold me and sit by me and watch tv id want them to truly get where im coming from so that i dont feel judged i just want someone who can carry some of this im alone because the people around me cant give me what i need can anyone relate,3.0

57319,just venting i am terribly depressed since childhood and every year it gets gradually worse i dread each aproaching winter and for the last few years the most beatifull sunny summer days made me feel even worse my experience with therapists is that they are uninterested hacks because every advice is the same shit about moving and exercising like its going to solve all my problems they dont care for what i have to say but cant wait to speak again theyre human after all when i tell them that i work out daily since  theyre at their wits end exercise is good though because its the only aspect in my life that i feel having controll over with nobody trying to stop me except for fitshamers but i dont care about them one positive thing i can say about myself is that i am very disciplined when im interested in something so when i was interested in having a sixpack i just went for it and got it im not interested in much else and working out has become a tedious daily chore antidepressants made me feel like a tasteless piece of tofu neither happy nor sad just empty and not really human i realised that id rather feel sad than feeling like that i guess i chose to be miserable last year i did acid for the first time and it was the most powerfull and overwhelmig experience i ever had i had an amazing day and afterwords i felt great for about three weeks straight not just not sad like on my usual good days but really happy is this how normal people feel all the time i dont think that i want to be high all the time but then again it was the only time since childhood that i felt genuinly happy and content to be honest i dont even know if i ever was a happy kid i look sad in about  of my childhood photos i have aspergers too so i realise that this is probably one of the sources of my misery just venting,3.0

57337,should i see a psychiatrist hi its been  years since i had some heavy personal problem which was nothing really serious but it made me feel destroyed at the time and i dont think i should go on detail now for the sake of concision and since then although i have lived a relatively normal life being functional and active i never really felt recovered from what happened anymore in the best days i am fine but in some days it gets really bad i dont wanna do anything cant go out just wanna sleep etc but then i get up of bed have a day and when im alone in bad i feel all the same things from the start of the day until i sleep nobody can really say that im not feeling good because i dont talk too much about myself to others not even family and when i am in social situations i tend to forget these things a little bit until im alone again in the summer things get worse i really dont wanna go out in any way and if i do its like im being tortured in these period i went to two therapists but i dropped the second about a year ago because i wasnt seeing any evolution with him and i dont have the disposition for talking about these problems at all times so i figured that therapy was just hurting me more by keep going back on the bad things that happened so i started to think should i see a psychiatrist could i be functionally depressed maybe i do need to take some medications,3.0

57401,deleting social media made me feel a lot less depressed im not the most social guy ever i have horrible anxiety and ive got a bad stutter so i prefer talking through messages when i can im also really into photography and spend a lot of my free time editing photos for social media i usually used instagram and facebook photo groups for my outlet i used to rely so much on social media to give me confirmation that i mattered to other people if i spent a long time on a photo and it ended up not getting any likes or comments id feel pretty bad about it and put in even more time trying to make my photos look perfect so that someone would give me validation a few weeks ago i realized that this obsessive behavior to stay relevant was drowning me in depression and decided to stay off social media for awhile when i did this i realized that none of my friends on facebook actually kept in touch with me afterwards and didnt seem to actually care about me i also noticed that my obsession with caring about what people thought about me seemed to go away deleting social media to me was like ripping off a bandaid it stings at first when you realize how irrelevant you may be but once you get over that feeling then you have a lot more time to do things you actually enjoy you can even meet some great people depending on your hobbiesthis obviously wont work for everyone with depression because we all have our own reasons for being depressed but try thinking about how much time you spend looking at social media when was the last time you actually saw something on facebook or instagram or wherever that personally affected your life in a major way its easy to get into that habit of mindlessly scrolling through your friends posts for hours but all this does for you is make you feel bad about your own life and wish you were as cool as them pretty much every social media site is a popularity contest of people bragging about how great their lives are try deleting all of your social media for  days and see how you feel afterwards,3.0

57407,i have overcome my suicidal thoughts  but i feel so exhausted trigger warning  i am talking about all the thoughts i had and i was at a dark space at that time about  months ago i slipped into a dark space it started with me crying at least twice a day for no reason other than to cry most times i felt sad and did not knew exactly why i was rather just very very sad additional crying started happening soon after it was usually thinking about a thing i said that day or a way i moved or me simply being there  and i felt anger and shame and sadness all at once for me being there so soon after i couldnt stop thinking how everybody would be so well off if it werent for me my kids would have a chance at a better mom my partner might meet the love of his life and i wouldnt be blocking the job i have for someone actually deserving it i did never actually try to kill myself i wished for it constantly until i made a pact with myself i would bring myself in a situation where i would likely end up dead i failed so there was me even not getting that right for the next  months i continued my thoughts but also tried to get better i practiced yoga everyday i tried to see the good in live but mostly i told myself over and over how my death  even if it looked like an accident  would scar my kids even if their second mom would be better even then i got better and i am functioning right now i dont feel this calm soothing fuzzy when i think about my death anymore but i am so exhausted  i wanna sleep and hide all the time everything feels scary now and i love my family still i am so disconnected from everybody as if they are shiny and beautiful from a different planet with me being muddy and disgusting i feel shame for myself when i am on a walk with my kids i hate how people look at these precious beings and i am there to soil them as i cannot help but soil everything i even look at all that makes me exhausted so how do i get over thatthere is a lot if i and me and i am so sorry for that i dont intend to be an egomaniac but maybe cant help it and again sorry for that,3.0

57461,struggling for the first time in years i thought that i had overcome my issues with depression ive always had anxiety but with counseling i figured out how to manage it for the most part however this past month ive realized that i havent a lot of it is circumstantial and i dont know what to do about it my wife was recently promoted from a bartender to a manager she went from working  monthurs to working  shifts that start as early as  am and end as late as  am  days a week i hate it i see her for maybe  hours a day and thats when shes getting ready for work and eating dinner before bed ive been trying to stay busy but there is only so much i can do in a day to pass the time i guess i should add that im a sahm with  kids that i homeschool so going out and getting a job or whatever to keep me busy isnt a viable option i want her to quit but then i feel super guilty about that it is a better job on paper but for the number of hours she has to work and the schedule its not worth it to me she says that she will quit if thats what i want for her to do but i dont want to have that type of control over her life she worked hard for this promotion and although ive never wanted her to take it she did and now here we are financially we could take the hit if she quit her job and found a bartending job somewhere we currently live with family so we dont have a crazy amount of bills i just dont know what to do when shes here im so anxious that i know my time is limited with her like yesterday she had the day off and i couldnt stop thinking about how much i dreaded her going to work today and then when shes gone i just feel so empty because i know that itll be after  pm when she gets off and then she has to shower eat and go to bed i also know how stupid all of this sounds and how i should just get over it because its a good job that shes lucky to have ugh idk im just so empty ,3.0

57589,time to spit all this shit out from late adolescence i have been suffering from depression depression along with my self anxiety and natural introversion has pretty much fucked up my significant years from around  to adulthood  i thought it would get better when college came but turns out freshmen year was the worst year of my life i had an image of what university was going to be like and all that prior to stepping into college my horrific experience at an orientation camp at college set the tone for my whole college experience really i joined this residence in freshmen year where they gave verbal abuse to freshers which was some bullshit about strengthening ones mental strength anyways i was scarred by that experience and was so hurt from that especially considering i was suffering from depression self anxiety and introverted self before that whats worse is that some random dude from that residence just came up to me one day after i quit that orientation camp and normality resumed and he said to be i find those who quit the orientation such pussies that felt like a fucking punch in the face and my self esteem reached an all time low as if it werent already at that moment i really wanted to just fucking punch that prick for even having the ego to say that and not knowing what i was struggling with but i let it go  anyways i spent pretty much the entire freshmen year trying to force myself to enjoy college even though i knew i was struggling i would try and force a smile around people when i was so done i met a few friends but i eventually ended ties with them in the spring term as i just got so depressed and they were constantly making fun of me well it was more sort of banter but i just couldnt take their shit anymore whats worse my grades obviously suffered as well and i pretty much spent the whole of my second year trying to chase my gpa which led to further downfall of the lack of building meaningful friendships and sense of isolation for most of my college life  there we go not much more to say but i had to let it all out sick of keeping this shit to myself,3.0

57748,whats the point aka my attitude towards everything  im an absolute wreck  ive probably been depressed for about half my life now  ive certainly had deeprooted problems with negative thoughts self loathing absent self worth self doubt defeatism and maybe at some points i was handling them or distracting myself from them better than others  but this past year or  months as ive tried to open up even the tiniest bit more and even just to myself ive realized how bad off i am  my self loathing and my inner demon that tells me im worth nothing other than death lives in a room in my mind that i cant open  i can hardly look through the gap under the door  and yet it has succeeded in shaping my reality like a room rotting with mold whose smells pervades the whole house  i dont believe in myself i dont think im an exceptional person a talented person a capable person  sure id like to think im worth not dying im not evil or a monster but by the standards set by reality of what it takes to make it in this world to support ones self im not worth it  i dont have what it takes  there are billions and billions of people out there who will sacrifice more than me struggle more than me suffer more than me in order to stay afloat  me  i dont see the point  im not competitive im not cut throat  if the world has to exist through some system of a few people fighting their way into positions to attain wealth while most are relegated to poverty all the while little to no consideration is given to anything not monetizable like the quality of the environment or the joy people get from spending time with a stable loving family then i cannot summon the passion to run that ratrace  what haunts me the most is that the people i knew throughout my life who died early via tragic accidents or some by suicide they all deserved to live way more than i do  they all deserved more time the ones who wanted more at least  thats just plain fact  i knew at least  people that were friends of mine all of which died  years before life expectancy would have you believe  and of whom were good people hard working people trying to make a contribution trying to help others trying to forge connections  taking time away from them and leaving me here is such a shame  i cant do with my life what they could have done with theirs i dont think ill kill myself  its too assertive  and there might still be a part of me thats holding out hope that ill find a way to get by  i started going to meetings a depression support group i found out about online  its the only  hours of meaningful social interaction i have every week  so i value it pretty seriously but i also hate the way the rest of my week feels in stark contrast to social contact with understanding and honest people  right well what i hope doesnt happen is i hope i dont get stuck in this stagnation for too long such that i lose all hope  or i go from feeling like nothing is worth it but that i cant wait to die and take it upon myself  i guess i am that vain that i would be ashamed to take my own life or at least i would prefer something else kill me before i do  hahahahaha  the ego trying to protect itself even in selfdestruction  hahahahaha absurd  well thats where im at  for the moment i dont feel i have anything to live for other than avoiding the shame associated with opting out  i dont see a solution i dont see a calling for myself a purpose  i cant see any light at the end of the tunnel but occasionally i can still coalesce together some wisps of optimism into an imagination of an encouraging future a change for the better around the bend a trace of light up ahead  like a flint it lights up some sparks and embers that burn for a bit allows me to continue on a little further and temporarily holds darkness at bay a little  like a stranded man in the desert out of water but able to gather small drips of condensation at dawn some days to provide respite from an otherwise barren subsistence,3.0

57972,antidepressants and natural supplements i was wondering if anyone has more knowledge on the interaction between wellbutrin and i am definitely out of my depths here but i know these basics  wellbutrin is an aminoketone classed as an atypical antidepressant ndri thus predominantly works on reuptake inhibition of the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters this sets it apart from more typical antidepressants classed as ssris which work largely on serotonin receptors   is an essential amino acid that is implemental as a precursor in the production and regulation of serotonin thus additionally melatonin its the byproduct of the brains processing of ltryptophan and has been proven to increase levels of serotonin as well as melatonin our bodys sleep hormone necessary for deep sleep and thus healing and higher brain myelination which can be importantuseful to repair dysfunctional neural pathways that can perpetuate unhealthy thought patterns and associations it is possible to reach dangerous levels of serotonin by supplementing with chemical proteins and amino acids which can lead to serotonin syndromeso since  hypothetically  and wellbutrin  work on different neural receptorssynapses are they safe to take together,3.0

58199,advice for dealing with suicidal thoughts hey all so at the beginning of the year i ended up attempting and then i saw a new psychiatrist and therapist and am on new medsbut im still having an extremely hard time dealing with my suicide thoughts to the point where it almost feels debilitating and i just am seeking advice for the best way you all deal with itive been walking my dogs when i can but we live in canada and theyre small dogs so i cant take them out for long i suppose it helps some but it still feels like there is this giant weight on meive also taken my art more seriously and do as much cleaning as i can around the houseany sort of advice is welcome,3.0
58200,dont know what to do next so ive been bettering myself tremendously for the last year i had terrible anxiety but managed to get over it with surprising success although it was pretty scary at times but in the process i noticed that a big part of my anxiety came from feeling alienated and inferiour to others because for others life and joy seemed so effortless and a big problem was that i never got fully invested in friendships because i felt like i would inevitably disappoint themlong story short i had anxiety but it had some underlying problems and disconnecting my social interactions from these problems made it much easier to connect meaningfully with people on the other side though it seems this underlying problem is that my baseline for happiness seems much lower than that of most people since i cant remember ever feeling different this is a bit hard to pinpoint as i cant just look at other people and compare their feelings to mine and the approach i used for my anxiety doesnt seem to work as i cant think of any reason why i shouldnt be as happy as others and while i had my troubles that created some issues such as anxiety and some with my sexuality none of them precede me feeling well depressedso im asking you for help to identify my problems ie how do i know if i have some form of depression how did you deal with your depression when you first noticed it might be the source of your problems and what steps could i take to further improve ive been quite frustrated with this lately and it feels kind of hopeless i will probably go see a doctortherapist but this will take time and if i find out more about how i feel beforehand it will be easier describing my situation to themthanks to everyone who takes the time to respond and feel free to ask questions of any kind,3.0

58242,should i be worried about my thoughts i f am in my midtwenties growing up i was never talked to about depression anxiety or really any of my feelings i was very moody around age  basically until now and my parents never really helped me figure out why and instead thought i was just being whiny and too old to act how i was and often blamed my friends and tried to get my school to do something i never did anything bad besides yell at my parents a lot i did relatively ok in schooli was also bullied for a few years about my weight skin and kind of weird clothes since then ive always felt kind of socially awkward with very low selfesteem and feel like im judged everywhere i goso basically i just grew up thinking something was just seriously wrong with me for being so mad all the time and i was the only one like thatfast forward to college and i had one year where i was not doing well at all i talked to my parents about seeing a therapist and they really looked at me like i was insane and said youre not going on medication and that was that i ended up seeking a therapist at my school and never told them now im a little older and understand how the world works a little better i see my own therapist we talk a lot about my continued lowself esteem and very obvious anxiety i always thought anxiety was something other people had but its definitely what i experience and it was just never talked aboutone time i did bring up depression with my therapist and she kind of brushed it off because she doesnt like it as a defining term i really kind of want to see a psychiatrist to know if somethings wrong on a chemical levelthe reasons for this post iswhenever i feel like i say something stupid or am causing issues i really say to myself i want to kill myself or i should just die and start thinking about ways to do it but not seriouslylast night this happened and i stared to wonder if this is how a path to suicide really starts and if i should be scared about not addressing my thoughts i havent told my therapist in fear of it coming off as just being dramaticrecently i found myself hitting my forehead with my hand after an embarrassing moment and i did this for a few days i have no other history of selfharm besides binge eatinganyways im looking for clarity on what im feeling i can get up in the morning but also have daily i want to die thoughts im wondering if my confusion is due to never being able to name my feelings as a child and always being yelled at for being upsetwhat is it really like when you see a psychiatristany insight would be helpful,3.0

58254,i feel so broken here is a long story of my traumatic experience with my torn acl it was november  my first preseason sophomore game we were supposed to play on the football field but football was in cifs so we played in the very bad field i was so happy and excited i was the captain of the soccer varsity team and we kicked off i was doing really good and then i did an over the ball step and stepped in a little dip and felt my knee and leg snapi was in excruciating pain and i felt paralyzed for a minutethen they lifted me upafter  minutes i was on the bench with my coach really worried saying shit you probably tore a ligament i thought my self he was overreactingim only out for  weeks was the first thing i thoughti never had a bad injury like this so i thought i was ok i was barely able to walk  my mom and girlfriend were telling me to go to the hospital but i denied barely keeping my breath about to pass out from the pain keep in mind im a tough guy i never cry from pain no matter how bad it isi broke my elbow and the pain was unbearable but nothing compared to what i feltthe game ended and my team won my coach told me to go to the hospital tomorrow and i agreedit was that same night and i was having so much pain i couldnt lay downthat whole night i couldnt sleep and it hit  in the morning where i had to go  i tried getting up and the moment my leg touched the ground i collapsed so hard i had a really sharp bad pain on my knee i tried limping and even worse when ever i would limp it would tug my leg down which it would hurt so much i would scream my only option was to crawl to the toileti then went and crawled  feet i finished and tried to crawl out now but this time it was hurting me more so i was stuck there i over heard my brother playing video games so i yelled for him to comehe came and i asked him if he can carry to my bedhe carried me to my bedi did not sleep that whole night and i missed school on the morningthe morning comes and my parents told me im not going to the doctors im going to the chiropractori agreed because my personal chiropractor always heals me up from my injury keep in mind i cant bend my leg at alllimp or crawlmy brother once again carried me to the car and we went to my chiropractor ive been going to her for years and helped with every injury i hadmy coach called and asked if i was going to the hospital i said no that im going to the doctors lying to him so he wouldnt get madthat is a mistake im going to regreti just wanted to go back to the sport that help me cope with my problems asapwe made it to my chiropractors house my brother once again carried me to the house and put me on the bed and i was laying therei wasnt scared i thought i was going to be ok and it wasnt going to be as painful as the moment of the injuryshe starts massaging my kneeshe said she never seen anything like thisshe is a  year old lady that has been doing this mostly her whole lifeshe is not certified she came from mexicoshe said my knee was so messed upwhen she was massaging my knee i didnt feel anythingall the times she massaged me there before that injury it would be painfuli thought to my self that this was going to be a piece of cakeshe then tells me to go on my stomach and tells me to breathe in and out and all of a suddena loud scream came out of my mouthshe started pushing my leg towards my backi was screaming so muchno pleaseeee stopp pleasee pleasee i was begging hermy brother came and held me downshe repeated this process till my leg touched my back  timesi started crying the pain was so badit was unbearablei never had pain make me cry before it was all so sudden  this by far the worst pain everit felt like someone was cutting off my leg with a chainsawmoments after she makes me lay on my back again and start extending my leg as straight as she can while im screaming and she starts tugging it with her might while im screaming she does that  timesi started getting a fever from the paini felt like passing outshe tells me to stand up and walk surprisingly i was able to walk again but barely only with my toe touching but painlesslyshe said to walk like that a lot so it can get used to it and i will be good in a monthi took  months off just in casethe next day i told my coach that the doctor just said it was sprained that i should take  months off and i will be goodim back with my team i was so happyi went to the first practice and i was sprinting back and forth the whole timei was so happy to be able to play the sport i lovei noticed that my knee felt unstable but didnt think much of itit was the first practice back and i felt so energetic i didnt get tired one bitwe were doing a drill where its a defender vs  offense and i was the defender and it was my turnthe offense was attacking me and the guy passed the ball beside me and i reached out for the ball to get it and i felt my knee snap againit hurt as much as the first timei started grabbing my knee but then my coach was looking so i got up and started jogging by the goal and sat down but the whole time i was forcing my self to jog through the pain barley putting any weight on my right legi started getting a fever again and the whole time i was sitting down i felt like passing out i sat out for the rest of the practicemy coach told me to just run around the field but i just hopped in to the drill from desperation practice ended and my coach told me to take  more weeks off so i would be back for our  actual league game and i was ok with that weeks past and i went to practice and the same incident happened again but the pain was less and i got up quicker was able to run a bit smoother then the other timethis time the coach didnt notice and i didnt mention anythingthis happened overall like about  more times till i had enough i was scared to play soccer i didnt feel right i felt like i would dislocate my knee any momentwhen i would turn to the side i can feel my thigh going to one side and my knee and leg going to opposite side i had to call it quits and probably realized my season is gone i still had no clue of the injurymy coach was confused through all this from the left out information i went up to my mom and told her that i need to get my knee checked out by a doctor so we didthe doctor said its just sprained but i disagreed that it doesnt feel right i know something is wrong and i begged her if i can get an mri and so she scheduled and mrithe day of the mri camei was in  period and my mom called me to the officei walked in the office and i saw my coachhe was surprised to see me there and asked me why i was there i said im taking my mri todayhe was excited and said that he is glad that they finally accepted my formmy mom said that i might be scared of the noises of the mri they put me in the machine and gave me ear plugs but i can still hear the noisesthe whole time i was in there i felt peace and tranquilitythe mri has finally ended and they said they will give me the results in  weekthe results came inmy heart dropped it said that i had a full thickness tear of my acl and a partial tear on my meniscusi felt so bad my coach was right i shouldve listened to him i messed upi realized how wrong i was only if i listened to him my mom was crying and my dad was stressed and felt at fault for taking me to the chiropractori told them its fineinside i felt brokeni dont like showing my emotionsim the positive person the uplifteri had a meeting with the orthopedics so they can give me my options with my knee this was around february  surgeon came in and was talking to my parentshe was really nice and then i popped up the question and asked him how long is the acl recovery to go back to sports and he said a yearmy heart sank i felt like crying so badi dont like showing my emotions in front of my parents so i held it and my parents looked sad and not guiltyhe said that the surgery will be scheduled april  and i asked if there was any earlier and he said no that the soonest i can get it and i was even more bummed out since i have a lower chance of playing but thats when i realized i should just give hope up on my junior year and just wait for my senior year to play and i felt so broken insidei felt like crying so badthen in march i hear about the corona virus outbreak spreading a loti didnt think much but my parents were worrieda week later i heard it spread to the usmore and more cases started coming in but i really didnt care or listenedi had one last meeting before my surgery which was the th of marchduring that time they canceled school for me because of the virusi walked into the orthopedics and my heart sankthey were checking peoples temperatures before they let them in and they checked mine and asked if i had any signs of  i said no and they let me init was so scarce the chairs were all separated from each other then i look back and i see my mom walking away and my dad coming inmy dad said that they didnt let in my mom that they only allow one person in and since im a minor its acceptablei was in the waiting roomthey called my name and saw my surgeontill this point im just about traumatized from everythinghe tells me that im not allowed to go outside of my house or come in contact with any human outside of my house if i do they have all rights of canceling my surgerythey said if i cough once that they will cancel my surgeryi didnt think it was bad if my surgery cancelsuntil he mentioned that my surgery is urgentits necessary i cant wait on it because i can get arthritis because of my partial tear of meniscusthat i cant wait longer because the virus can get worse and if i dont get it on april  then it will probably be till  months and that will be to latethey also said that it depends on the government if they dont cancel surgeries across the usim just about scared shittless by this point i didnt sign up for all thisi dont want to be told thisits so traumatizing for a teenagerhe also proceeds to mention that i can only have one visitor after my surgeryi thought to myself if it can get any worsehe then gave me the information and not to do before the day which is do not eat at midnighti leave the orthopedics and i see my mom cryingshe said she is scared for mealso my dad was facetiming my mom so she can hear what the doctor was sayingi told her to not worry its going to be fine and the one that should be worried is meeven though i was just so broken in a million piecesas of writhing this im in quarantine  days so far i havent stepped foot outside of my house for  days i feel trapped and emptyi am in a really dark place as of right nowmy surgery is in  days as of writing thisplease dont share this to my coach or tell him i just wanted to tell you my experienceupdate from march  and i got news that someone tested positive for the corona virus at the hospital i was supposed to get surgery tomorrowmy surgery has been canceled a day awayeverything was just traumatic them telling me and forcing me to stay in my house for  weeks straight just some idiot to not follow what the doctors told that person to do and get infected and ruin it for everyone else its unfairit was a little hospital for surgeryim guessing the patient didnt take serious what the doctors told that person to do and went out and traveledits really painful stressful for me to take inthank you if you have read this far,3.0

58277,i need some motivation on  i had a grade ii astrocytoma removed from my left temporal lobe on  i had a grade iii astrocytoma removed the tumor had worsened and was then classified as cancer i am currently a graduate student and have had to balance cancer treatment radiation and chemo and school for the past few years treatment ended about  months ago but i still have to see my oncologist every so often my most recent visit was on  and thankfully there was nothing new however at no point over the past few years has my doctor used the word remission i never think to ask him when im there so i sent him an email asking whether this word applies to me and whether he could make any ballpark estimate given my personal situation regarding my life expectancy there is currently no tumor so im aware that its a naive question for me to ask he has made it very clear to me that there is no way of knowing and that statistics can mean nothing in these situations but given the fact that i have had two brain tumors removed the most recent of which is classified as grade iii cancer i will likely not live more than  years i wish i could say i was not slightly relieved by this however as of today my fiance the woman ive been with for the past  years is officially out of my life on christmas i noticed that she seemed upset and when i talked to her that night she didnt yet have her thoughts in order but i had a feeling i knew what was happening we very awkwardly spent the next day together going to see my oncologist after that she said she needed time to herself i knew right then what was going to happen consequently the past two weeks have been the most emotionally challenging times ive ever experienced ive gradually watched as she removed every trace of me from her social media accounts i am now  years old and single for the first time since i was   may not seem like a terrible number but i cant help but doubt that i will ever find someone and have a family before my time is up  i had been with her for so long and im so accustomed to her and only her that its so hard for me to even imagine talking to or being with another woman i know my life expectancy is entirely indefinite but those numbers mean something to me i dont want to give up and assume that im going to die tomorrow but i cant imagine having a genuinely successful longterm relationship with someone who knows that i will likely not be around for very long part of me is relieved to know that itll all be over soon but a bigger part of me wants something to look forward to fyi we ended on relatively good terms i did not like being left in the dark for two weeks but i dont blame her for ending it,3.0

58510,perspective   i am a middle aged man who has mostly lived in the same city all of his life had for the most part have had very little success at making friends in  i was basically diagnosed by a psychologist with either some type of schitzo or border line personality disorder though it was never made official moving head i have always been a little different but try to be as sincere of a person that i can be and am generally polite nice etc i do however have an odd since of humor and perspective that others dont seem to understand where people seem to tolerate or interact generally well with me in a work scenario no one seems to let me into their lives outside the organize environment i try to compensate my oddness by adjusting my mannerisms to the company i am around but i mostly sit quietly trying to get a feel for what is going on i am afraid that people get the wrong impression when i do this and dont involve me i feel empty as i cannot achieve a connection of with anyone i have a suspicion that there are times that people talk about me trying to reconcile with each other reasons why they should not get to close this is really taking its toll on my life and i am kind of lonely lost eveni always get excuses that these people are busy they dont know what they are going to do and cant make a commitment or they are hanging out with some other friends am i reading this wrong should i quit trying to make friends and accept my circumstances should i call them out on it just to see where i stand with them,3.0

58687,shit life by no means am i saying my life is the worst i know other people have it way worse than i mine has just been shit after shit with no light anywhere elementary school was fine but as soon as i get to middle school it took a turn for the worsefrom  grade to my senior year ive been unbelievably bullied nonstop in middle school i went to a predominately black school and i thought id be relatively accepted there but nah that wasnt the case it fucked me up pretty badly where my barely into my teens ass thought no woman in my race would ever want mei know that i was in my preteens and i shouldnt have been worried about any of that but it still got to me shit it still affects me to this day my so called friends back then if you want to call them that would often do the same even though they so how hurt i would feel they even abandoned me at one point but my naive self just went crawling backhigh school wasnt much different only real difference was that i actually found real friends it helped but the shit that happened from middle school dragged its ugly head into high school it felt like the bad outweighed the good now often times i look at myself and wish i was someone else someone who never went through any of this someone with confidence that never fades in a blink of an eye i just wish i wasnt myself i dont want to be me anymore,3.0

58818,gf ended things on valentines day feeling mentally and physically weak we had a relationship of nearly  years though it was very long distance for at least half the time and we are still in school she was my first real love  in january she decided she wanted to take a break i agreed and have had feelings like that in the past—that a break would be good for us and allow us to grow and experience college but now i just hurt ive had a nasty cough for a while and that plus my anxiety keeps me up for most of the night ive been to a few counseling sessions that have helped me think about my situation but i dont think ive gotten better i know that isnt supposed to fix anything but its painful to mope around she knows how i feel and i fear pushing her away and making her not ever want to even try again because im too crazy or weak or not the person she loved i romanticized our reunion i thought it was a  chance on valentines day i asked her if she still loved me and she said she didnt know she said she keeps thinking about the negative nuances of our relationship and things i did that hurts really bad knowing youve hurt someone else but too late now she said she doesnt know if she wants to try again when she originally said i had been looking forward to that so much during or after the summer it was keeping me goingshe said she still loves me as a person in her life and i believe her  but the fact that she doesnt want to be together or want to try again for a long time hurts really bad she explained a  year test to me which basically would be for us to move on from each other be with other people for a while and work on ourselves then in  years time we could assess where our professional live have taken us after school and see if we want to date again  i totally understand where shes coming from it sounds fun and practical but my brain wont let me forget how happy i was with her and how i lost that im stuck she was my other half and so now ive lost half of who i am im scared to move on i know i probably can but will anyone make me as happy as her my nightmare probably selfish is that she has someone she loves more than me in  years it makes me sick its morbid perhaps but im not in the right headspace now i might have the option of visiting her during my spring break—our schools breaks do not coincide the week after that shes going to miami with her friends for her spring break which also gets stuck in my head as i know shell probably get with other guys i know ill be so happy to see her but i also know its probably not smart will i get closure or a chance to recognize how i might be romanticizing what we had we used to talk on the phone every day that was such an important part of my sanity that i dont realize until it was gone havent gotten more than  hours of sleep in a few weeks usually less i feel unproductive and physically weak from my cough my head physically hurts from no sleep i have too much in my head  ,3.0

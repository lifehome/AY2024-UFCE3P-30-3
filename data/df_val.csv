58929,annus horribilus today is the anniversary of my daughters death she died in my arms and i am grateful i could be with her she was  and we were very close cut from the same clothshe had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism creating the perfect storm that resulted in her death she made no secret of her desire to die but her death wasnt suicide per sein the year prior to her passing i was diagnosed with esophegal cancer and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment nobody expected me to live and i think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on meduring my time in hospital my ex wife my daughters mother came to stay with my daughter to care for her ive since discovered from reading my daughters reddit emails and texts that her mother was drink and abusive the whole timei demanded to be released from hospital early as my daughters health had deteriorated and they made arrangements to get me home i was unable to speak in more than a whisper had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but i was happy to be home with my daughter we spent quality time togetherwhen she died a few weeks later i arranged the funeral and the wake i couldnt deliver a eulogy or even toast her lifemy daughter had very few friends partly because of her treatment resistant depression and partly because she just didnt suffer fools lightly but the friends she did have she treated like gold one was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt and my daughter drove  kms to visit him and she went back every day for days on end just as example none of them could manage to get to her funerali have recovered mostly now but i dont know why i dont want to live especially after this past yeari am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very very special daughter without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness,3.0

59112,im a disappointment to my family a precursor i dont believe in god not sure if my family explicitly knows thati can see it in my dads demeanor when he so much as brings up church to me often he will give me choices like are you coming with me to church today its a question but its not as simple as saying yes or no if i say yes i end up going obviously but when i say no he kind of sighs and says okay and then walks away now its good right i got what i wanted im not going to church today well yeah but now im reminded of how much of a disappointment i am for not being religious im not sure if my parents know for sure that i dont believe in god if they do theyre in denial all my life ive been forced to go to church and all my life ive hated it my parents know that but they still force me into it because its good for me and it will help me realize that i do believe in god and as said by my dad before when i confronted him on this i need to know where to go for the future when i decide i believe in godthats such a weak excuse the only reason they want me to go is so i might be persuaded into believing that stuff and they can pretend our family is nice and religious to please everyone else my mom likes to tease me about it i guess its not really teasing let me just give an example once after our ritualistic prayer before dinner she asks me if i really believe the things im saying if im really thanking god for my meal keep in mind my dad had asked her the same question like a week before and she got super offended and defensive about itbut in response i stayed silent which kind of answered for itself i think she knew the answer to that she just wanted me to admit it she wanted me to admit that i dont believe in god in front of my heavily religious dad so he can look disappointed in me and she can lecture me about it the thing is i dont mean the things i say i just say them so i wont have to hear her or dad lay into me about not praying and disrespecting god i know if i dont say the prayer theyll be upset with meshe often makes little jokes about how i dont like church or my lack of faith all in front of my dad on the way to church it just creates the most tension ive ever felt in one car if im being honest its like she is reassuring me that the way im thinking is bad and wrong and goes against everything that is right it just reassures me that she thinks that im in the wrong for not believing the same things she does and i know my dad thinks that even if he doesnt tell me thats not the only thing theyre disappointed in me for though im also bisexual which i know they wouldnt approve of i havent come out yet for that specific reason and i probably wont until ive moved out and dont have to see them everyday i know the response from everyone in my family would be negative and judgemental and thats not really something i want right now theyve already done that to my cousin who came out as trans a few years ago my mom still uses his dead name as well as referring to him with sheher pronouns but i dont think she really remembers well since she is very forgetful it also doesnt help that ive been outed to her before and she talked to me about it once and then forgot about it its like how do you forget something significant about your child like that theyre also disappointed in my lack of energy which irritates me the most i really do try to keep things nice and neat and do productive things but it never works out and usually drains all my remaining energy my room is constantly a mess and my mom likes to remind me that i need to get myself together because how will you make it living on your own if you cant pick up after yourself like wow i havent thought of that before that happens to be a general fear i have of the future one of many she doesnt understand that saying those things isnt helping but only making me feel worse about myselfthey regularly call me lazy when in reality im really trying to make myself be productive believe it or not it upsets me just as much probably more as it does them that i cant seem to keep all my stuff organized and neat and put away theyre always reminding me of how lazy i am and how they dont understand how i can live like that newsflash i cant understand eitheri dont know why i have  energy for the majority of the time but i do and maybe it is just me being lazy and ungrateful because i know theyre doing everything for me maybe thats how it really is and i need to stop being so reliant on other people to take care of me a lot of times i feel like a burden and thats really all i am it makes me feel shitty and i start telling myself that shes right and why am i being so lazy why cant i just do things correctly like other people are supposed to why dont i believe in god like im supposed to they dont have to tell me straight forward i know theyre disappointed by me from the subtle things and all it does is make me feel worsesorry i bitched for so long im just a wimp lol,3.0

59183,ive been healthy my entire life why does my brain want to kill me ive been happy my entire life had some issues with low self esteem and whatnot but nothing serious at all then since  years ive spiraled in to depression my understanding now is that it was  because of occupational burnout last year i had an extremely stressful job that dealt the final blow i tried to go back to school after  months of gruelling struggle i had to quit that too now im home  on sick leave ok fine i have to take it easy for a while recuperate from stress ive always loved being alone i can play lots of videogames and have an ok time materially my life is actually pretty great but fuck that my brain and my body wants me to fucking die thats what its telling me every day  in my thoughts in my feelings in my dreams i have subconscious that scares the shit out of me because its as black as bile i havent met a single fucking doctor or psychiatrist that has ever said or done anything that has helped me in any way ive had a serious anxiety had to learn myself how to defeat it but it doesnt matter now cause now i feel extremely depressed and anhedonic and i cant do anything about it i cant even meet friends because social situations stress me out extremely and can lead to symptoms that go on for days it doesnt matter how i calm i try to be in my conscious mind how many reassuring thoughts i try to think every day i wake up and feel like i should diei had a psychologist last year i trusted him but now in retrospect i feel like he was just a wine drinking intellectual fuck wad that neither knew how to help nor cared about me thats the thing no doctor or psychiatrist truly cares and nobody knows what i feel like i have thoughts and nightmares checking in to a psychiatrist ward get triggered as hell by the people inside and then never check out besides i feel like no psychologist can help me i feel like its  chemical depression if i could snap out of this sickness my life would be better than ever i dont see what i would be unhappy with especially as ive fought so hard to get to where i am today but fuck that my brain wants me to diethe only medicine i take is mirtazapin and it doesnt do rat shit except probably amplify my nightmares i tried an ssri medicine for a month but had serious anxieties and nightmares so stopped maybe should try again some days i even cough blood which is creepy as fuck i went to a doctor about it and she said i was fine and it was probably a side effect of my medicine sometimes i see scary shit inside my eyelids before i go to sleep i try my best not to worry my psychologist told me i dont have ptsdso many times ive had a short good streak earlier this month i had  full week were i felt okish and things were heading in the right direction then bam i get in a stressful situation and im back to feeling worse than ever right now i feel so much anger when i think about how far ive fallen i just want to punch something id cut myself if it wasnt that i consciously know thats a bad idea and thats all i am a conscious mind pulling a round a fucking carcass of a body a brain infected by a black bile that somehow doesnt exist what did i do to deserve this why does my brain want to kill me,3.0

59197,am i making myself miserable what can i do to feel better ever since i started really growing up ive become depressed at age  i  would hit big slums of depression and it would take a month to crawl out now im  and it gets worse the reasons vary from failed tests my parents fighting being single having nobody to talk to and nothing to do id like to address some of the aforementioned items on that short list going down the list ill start at failed tests and bad grades id always get made fun of for being stupid i went to a private school up until this year so the curriculum was pretty intense and fast paced my only bad grades were really english and math math was the worst usually a d average id always feel sick to my stomach when i got an grades back even if they were good i felt like if i didnt do good i wasnt worth the teachers time i hated myself for being so stupid next is my parents always fighting whether it was my mom being late to pick my dad up from the airport or us being tight on money that month my parents would always get into a shouting match i used to go hide in my room and hold my teddy bear when i was  or  but now i just turn the tv or my music volume up to try and drown it out i always try to be a moderator and get them to stop because i love them but they dont love each other i felt like if i couldnt stop them then it was my fault they got into it next is being single and very lonely i mentioned going to a private school well it was  miles away that meant  miles every day for  years plus extra activities like boy scouts cap and sports having to drive so far made it hard to have a social life with my friends if i couldnt go home with them for the weekend or anything i never went to any football games they were always too loud for my sensitive hearing issue i never went to any dances any parties any anything that wasnt just hanging out at someones house the only thing i really did that was social was play airsoft last summer i met some guys and they took me in to their team so now i have a second family to go to theyre always there if i need them but back on topic ive never been in a relationship never had anyone be interested in me never even held hands or been on a first date my spanish club had a speed dating event last year and i went hoping maybe i could meet someone well all it really was was the teacher asking really awkward questions and us answering them they were stuff like who was your first kiss and where was your first date and other corny stuff about yourself i felt like a massive loser because i couldnt answer half the questions sure girls would be flirty with me but after hanging out for a while we would just become friends and nothing more and thats how its always been flirting losing interest and im left holding the bag of my unexpressed feelings this year its been even worse so bad you cant even imagine the same thing happened except a little different its my freshman year and i joined jrotc its a good program with a little hitches and i joined the raider team ive gotten a lot more physically fit since i joined and i have really likes the experience finally something that i can fell good about that doesnt require academics but on the the sad part i met a girl i wont name any names but she was perfect she came here from california and enjoys photography so i show her some of my really good pictures and we sort of hit it off and become great friends have you even fallen in love with someone but you knew you should wait i have and it doesnt make you feel better i waited and waited and waited to ask her out homecoming comes around and i asked one of our mutual friends to see about her plans for the dance well im glad i waited long enough because someone else asked her out and got rejected hard she has a boyfriend in montana and hates dancing phew am i glad i waited and dint make a fool of myself but that was a short and bittersweet relief from then i fell into a spiral of depression and loneliness because i had fallen in love with someone i could never have i felt like there was something wrong with me even though i knew i was being completely irrational i hated myself and felt like nobody would ever love me last is having nothing to do i usually waste away my weekends on my computer playing games browsing reddit or  or watching youtube on the rare occasion that i go play airsoft which is about once every two months during school almost every weekend during summer i get to see my teammates and i get to socialize with them at school i have friends a considerable amount even but i dot really hang out with them much i haven seen my friends from my old school even though we were the best squad in the school i guess what im trying to say is i dont go out enough and if i had something to occupy my time i wouldnt be so lonely  can anybody offer my some advice on any of the topics i listed thanks for reading this text wall tldr i hate my life myself and im extremely sad and lonely despite having lots of friend and being moderately fit and not overweight can anybody help me,3.0

59212,to make you more happy a lot of people these days do not feel happy so i decided to help the people that are not feeling happy not being happy can have many causes therefore i can not guarantee that the method that i am going to explain will help for everyonefirst of all i want to say that i do not recommend you to suppress your emotions feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways it can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed but as a child probably almost everyone told you ¨i want you to be happy¨ therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy so you feel even more bad than you did before but like i just said your emotions can be helpful in many ways so you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happyin todays society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly and if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again and at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts and then there comes a point that they are just living in their head and because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore people can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example ¨did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work¨ they will probably say ´´no i didnt see it´´ so they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore so try to still your mind by for example meditation if you want mediation techniques feel free to ask you can even send me a dm quintenvanommen once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again on your way to work you can see the appletree you can see the apples you can see the apples falling and if you eat you are just eating your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating and than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea once you are doing this you will experience life again and you will probably become more happyhave a nice dayyours sincerely quinten van ommen,3.0

59216,i feel selfish and dumb calling myself depressed should i even consider this depression i just have a distinct lack of motivation to go after any asperations i have even if i truly want to the reason i dont like calling myself depressed is because even though some of the things i tell myself every other day are absolutely awful the fits i have are fleeting and short lived and i am a teenager so they might just be mood swings idk its not like i always hate myself but when i do its fucking awful im of course basing this off of words i force myself to remember as i have adhd and a shit sleep schedule so i very quickly forget what things truly feel like as a result i dont really believe it myself my parents are one of those people who believe depression is a state of mind as opposed to a disease and recently during an important test for school there were so many different voices in my head each saying different horrible things about me i almost started crying because it took me an extra hour to get it done i even remember saying to myself that i need to go to therapy i know for a fact that i wont kill myself for the forseeable future ive ran the scenario through my head and decided the cons outway the pros im just scared of whats gonna happen the one particularly shitty day when i no longer see it that way i want to atleast talk to a therapist but i dont want to look like a fucking idiot to my parents and i dont want to waste their time i used to go to a therapist but my parents took me off after i never disclosed my issues i never fixed anything and every time i remember it i feel like shit are my thoughts verified im too embarressed to ask my parents to get me diagnosed so i just want some validation in the mean time,3.0

59351,my depression got worse since university ive  always been an emotionally complicated child but my unhappiness worsened  drastically when my mother passed away from cancer around  years ago after that i lost interest in almost everything and anything i used to draw create bake write cook read and feel so happy doing all these hobbies but i can barely pick up a pen now and all i do to pass the time is lie in bed and watch pointless youtube videos losing passion has made my university application so much harder i had been a high achieving student before but at the end of the year my high school results were nowhere near my expectations throughout school i did get into a bachelors though but then i had no idea what to choose as a major or what i wanted to do in life it doesnt help that my father has very high expectations for me and wants me to become a doctorlawyer throughout the application process he was silent while i needed guidance but once i randomly chose my subjects and finalised enrollment he ranted and screamed at me for being a disappointment lazy for choosing something that wouldnt land me a job i live by myself now for university and although i have friends from high school i find it hard to connect with them and it feels as if i am wearing a mask when im communicating with them i feel guilty for not being sincere with them but i know that i shouldnt burden them with my real self i also have a hard time making friends in my classes so when classes end i go home and go to sleep i sleep for  hours every night ill have  hour after noon naps as well on weekends i spend most of the day sleeping or lying in bed watching videos im severely depressed because i feel as if i have no direction in life the course ive chosen doesnt interest me at all and im not doing very well in it the only thing that probably gives me joy is my long distance boyfriend but everyone disapproves of the long distance i barely get to talk to him because he works during the day and high school relationships tend to end in the first term of uni im scared of losing him i feel so guilty for feeling the way i do my life isnt particularly difficult and people are often in much harder positions that i am i feel like im not worthy of being helped because i feel like im faking it but at the same time i desperately dont want to feel like this tldr sleep too much and depression due to uncertainty in life and not having any passion in university subjects ,3.0

59409,having constant thoughts of suicide  hi as the title says ive been having recurring thoughts of suicide for the past few years nearly every daythe first time i remember suicidal thoughts rearing its head was in  at that time i was  and in my second or third year of university i was taking it from home through an online course and the deadlines exams and assignments were killing me my family prioritised achievement over everything else so there was always constant pressure to do well to the extent that i would literally measure my selfworth through my grades or how hard i worked i couldnt really handle the amount of work that was being thrown at me so my mental health took a nosedive and due to the stress of it all my physical health also followed suitduring that time i would constantly and actively fantasise about suicide and think through plans to see which would be the least painful way to go out i tried telling my family about it and at first it wasnt met with very much sympathy at the time they more or less dismissed it as exam stress getting to me my parents also were reluctant to get me help as they basically considered therapy paying money to have someone talk to you and antidepressants as drugging yourself i couldnt really seek help myself as i am a minor living at home and am not financially independentso i basically suffered through it without any proper mental help or support apart from that of my family dont get me wrong i do appreciate them taking their time out of their day to listen to my venting but it just wasnt adequate i felt like i was going crazythis continued for a long time the worst bout of suicidal ideation ive ever had was actually rather recently about two months ago in fact when i was studying for my professional exams in finance cfa level  studying for that was by far one of the most mentally gruelling things ive ever done due to the sheer amount of material there was to remember in that exam when i finished that exam i was planning to take a while off for the first time in years i thought everything would be better that i could actually have time to get my mental state back on trackbut im now taking the time off and i still feel utterly terrible and im still falling back into contemplating suicide im honestly not even sure of the exact reason why ive always thought my depressive feelings were related to how much studies or work i had to do but it turns out thats not the only factor causing it despite how much my circumstances change its as if theres this void in me that cant ever really be fillednothing feels enjoyable nothing feels right and i feel absolutely guilty because i finally have time off and im still not liking it at all i feel bad that im such a downer when im around my family despite how much they try to accommodate me because no matter what happens there is this constant listless empty feeling that just claws at me as if there is something so fundamental missing from my life i dont know what that would be but i just know i need more,3.0

59507,wasted my life and have only been going downhill hi all seems like every day just gets worse and success feels more distant im in my late  and live back at home again working a minimum wage fast food position i absolutely hate my job and dread it daily as it requires me to work pretty odd hours i have actually quit but they said theyd do anything to make me stay so i cut my shifts a bit but now i just have less money and less hope i was fine with living at home until a year ago i got my first taste of a full time position in the field of my education but it only lasted  months as the company closed doors soon after i have been out of school for  years and have very little hope in finding something ever again due to my field of study i made a mistake in what i chose to do and fear going back and having the same thing happen a main reason i hate living at home is because im criticized for not having a real job by all my parents friends and they have laughed in my face many times i feel like life is only going down for me i started medication for depression and that hasnt helped much i dont know where else to go from here and i feel like l living is pointless i used to live in a big city have a lot of friends and always had plenty of luck with women now i have  friends literally not one live in the country and women dont take a second look at me i feel like giving up i dont want to be that old man living with my parents and being a burden anymore ,3.0

59660,something i wrote tonight to help me i thought id share the worst thing about depression is that its an endless loop of feeling bad you feel bad for whatever reason then you feel bad for feeling bad while you have loving family and friends decent job and a good life then you feel bad for not knowing whats wrong with you and then even worse because you cant find a fix to end all this you think that this loop might be what is making you feel bad that youre stuck so you take a deep breath and reset the loop you start to feel better you clean up your place you take a shower maybe even make lunch but definitely you make some coffee you enjoy these moments where the voices in your head shut the fuck up and you start feeling ok this goes on for a while until it happens again you start feeling bad for reasons unknown to you and the cycle restarts sometimes it feels like an actual washing cycle pardon my rudimentary knowledge of washing cycles terminology you start by having your thoughts in your brain then you start adding a little bit of overthinking your handy high efficiency detergent then the cycle begins your thoughts slowly start to move around in circles first excited that the detergent is helping you feel like youre getting somewhere your thoughts start to feel organized and constructive thats until you start the spin everything starts moving so fast the circles never ending the voices inside the machine is deafening your thoughts desperately try to reach out for air to no avail the movement is too fast you feel like youre being simultaneously pushed outside and drawn to the middle of this centrifuge you cry for help but not even you can hear over the rhythmic sound of this cycle this goes on for minutes hours days you lose track of time time stands still during this trip but then out of nowhere the cycle slows down you realize that you made a bigger deal of this than you should have you breathe again settling into this new wrinkled mashed up reality that you find yourself in the door opens you see the light you believe that the exit of this cycle is in sight only to find yourself thrown into the dryerdepression isnt fun movies and tv shows usually portray it as something that you can fix just by figuring out what causes it you dig deep trying to find out why you are the way you are is it the loss of your mother is it because you dont talk to your best friends as much as you want to because we are all busy is it your hopes for a better future for you and everyone crashing down after you realize how terrible this world is or maybe it is because you lost touch with all your school friends is it because your past relationships didnt work and you cant seem to figure out how to make a new relationship work is it because you think theres something fundamentally wrong with you that makes you unlovable i mean even your mother whos supposed to love unconditionally isnt there anymore granted that she probably didnt choose to die at the age of  in the middle of the most stressful period of your teenage years but how could she do that is it even possible to feel loved after the loss of your mother its like the part inside of you that makes you feel loved died with her you slowly realize that theres no point to anything you do because you simply cant see the proud look in her eyes when youre done you start spiraling again this time doing things youre not used to you pick up new habits habits that you know your mom would never approve of but why does it matter so much its all pointless anyway but it does matter to you what if shes looking down on you right now shaking her head in disappointment but would she be disappointed after all shes your mom she loves you she would understand you hope she wouldyour eyes get watery now you cant see or think straight anymore you wish your laptop would explode now and takes half your body with it but this is unrealistic you wish for the ceiling to fall down on you maybe not the whole thing just enough to get you killed on the spot without causing much trouble to your upstairs neighbors maybe you should go for a drive and fall off a bridge accidents happen no one would ever know it was by design you go for a smoke but you realize you hate the smell of cigarettes the smoke fills your mouth and your lungs and even a little seeps into your head but this isnt enough to change anything you wish youd just stop breathing but if you die now your family would suffer in their grief over you or at least you wish theyd grief youyou feel the walls in your head closing in you feel paralyzed you dont know where youre going and you want to talk but nobody will listen to you not because people are selfish and self centred but because you make sure that no one ever sees this side of you you are a strong man whos gone so far and done so much no one can see the weakness only strengthyou are tiredyou want to sleepyou hope you never wake up but you do you put on your brave face put a smile on and just keep moving,3.0

59693,was teetering on the brink broke up with my girlfriend tonight im worried about a nosedive long time lurker first time poster this is probably going to be more of a rantvent post so please bear with me basic background been onoff depressed for about  years i have severe trust issues and its really hard to open up to people and be emotionally vulnerablethat said i finally allowed myself to be close to and vulnerable to someone id been sorta dating for a few months nowso wed been house sitting for a friend of hers but i went back to my flat on saturday because she was hosting a close friend of hers for her birthday weekendon sunday she said she wanted a day to herself to decompress and i was glad to oblige im the same wayturns out that she had a guy over and yeah that said wed basically agreed to a poly situation but thats not the same as an open relationship she didnt consult me nothing so obviously i take issue with what happened and explain that if theres any salvaging this we just need to be exclusive at first she agrees to this then back tracks and basically says the relationship isnt healthy and were better off apart i think hope i will come to see that shes probably rightbut i felt the first real connection with someone for the first time in maybe a decade i told her things hardly anyone knows and she was therenow i feel alone ashamed that i let myself be vulnerable and though its frustratingly ironic this is compounded by my realization that i may be on the brink of a major depressive episode because i took these risks and it didnt work outim not sure what response im expecting but thanks for listening ,3.0

59838,ive messed job things up the last year and a half and now im screwed ive just made very poor decisions over the last year and a half and now im in trouble job wisei was laid off from a job i had for  years a year and a half ago i sent out resumes and had  job offers fairly quickly but as i always do i make the wrong decision im just bad a making good decisions and its not like i dont think things out i do i just made the wrong choice i picked the wrong job i always make the wrong decision and id do anything if i could go back in time and pick that other jobcouldnt stand the new job hated it dreaded going in i finally left on good terms of course got a temp job that had a possibility of going perm but it wasnt going anywhere after a couple months i took another job  this job was worse than the other i ended up leaving just dreaded going in  another bad choice went back to the same temp job amazingly they wanted me back because im a good worker and i liked it there but they wouldnt hire me i left that for yet another job that was even worse than the other two  just pure bad lucki left that job and now its been  months and i havent worked because the last year and a half on my resume looks like shit and i havent even listed everything i only have  of the jobs i worked and some dead space in between so it looks like im a guy who just leaves jobs which in reality i was for a while which ive never been before now im screwedi cant get a job i cant get any real company to hire me because of the stupid decisions i made i tried altering my resume to make it more appealing by lying about job dates but two jobs i came close to getting found out my resume had some lies on it datewise and that ended that i know most companies check but some dont  the last job i had they hired me in the second interview and never even checked my references or job history  i was just hoping to have that again somewhere but nopei dont know what to do now but i cant sleep or eat and im running out of money because im an idiot i just want to kick myself in the head i should have just stayed the first job and suffered at least id have a checkand now i cant even get a crap job im literally considering uber which is making me more depressed but if i dont get some money in soon im in big troublesorry for the long rant but i just needed to write this out im so goddamned depressed right now i cant see straight,3.0

59889,college has ruined my life for a bit of backstory im  years old i live with my parents and i live in a town with a population of  people i graduated in  and did nothing but play video games for two years i have no friends that live in my town because they left as soon as they graduated there is no opportunity for work in my town and ive failed my drivers test three times and now i have to retake my learners all of this made me a pretty pathetic person i was deeply depressed contemplating suicide multiple times my parents are very loving but have a hard way of showing it whenever i opened my feelings to them they would get mad at me for being upset when all i did was laugh and play my xbox all day my immediate family is horrible they constantly call me the weakest link of the family mostly because im the oldest of my cousins but ive accomplished the least this of course worsened my depression so after two years three failed attempts at a drivers license and a whole lot of gaming sessions later my dad was diagnosed with cancer during his treatment we visited him almost every day during one of those visits my parents were bickering about how ive done nothing with my life for so long overhearing this and having observed the nurses i thought that it would be an okay route to take after telling my parents that i wanted to be a nurse my parents were overjoyed and signed me up for prerequisite classes that fall fast forwarding to now im starting my second term of college on academic probation and i hate it now more than i did doing nothing my mother works in the city that i go to college in and she starts work at  the city is an hour and a half away so we leave around  this itself is fine and dandy but its the fact that most of my classes are at  which makes it terrible i get to school around  and sit around for   hours doing nothing i dont feel comfortable walking around as the college is in a very sketchy part of the city and despite trying i havent made a single friend in the almost five months that ive been attending i do take some time to study and because of the time i have i never have any late assignments but it doesnt matter anyways because no matter how hard i try i get terrible marks ive tried attending help classes and getting tutored but i guess i just dont have the smarts to stay afloat so on top of bad grades no friends living in isolation almost no family support college is effectively ruining my life even more than i was before that along with my beloved dog sophie who was basically my only friend died unexpectedly after having her for almost ten years i have no idea what to do anymore if i quit i have no job opportunities in my town and no license yet if i stay im in college for something that i dont want to do sitting around for  hours a day in a blank room i feel like there is mo winning scenarios here and my depression keeps getting worse and worse i see all of the friends i has move on get girlfriends excel in what they wanted to do and i cant help but let jealousy get the better of me they all look so good and so happy while here i lay a depressed ugly fat  year old guy ive begun contemplating taking my own life again knowing that im to much of a coward to do it and even if i could i cant do that to my mom and dad they may not show their care on the outside a lot but i know they love me and i could never do that to them so in final this was me venting my pitiful life to you thanks for reading knowing that nothing will change from writing this i will likely continue to live in this tiny town which is practically my personal hell i will likely continue to struggle with college in a major i dont want and i will almost certainly prove to my family that i am the pathetic weak link that they always said i was thanks for reading this if you did feel free to leave your thoughts if youd like human interaction of any kind is something that i dont seem to get much of these days,3.0

59993,i feel so sad when i read the articles on here why cant i feel sad for myself and give myself a break for once long context skip straight to the last part if you wantso ive been overly critical of myself for over  years now and no matter how well i do anything my brain doesnt think so im tired of constantly listening to all these selfhate thoughts and how everyone hates me for this and that and how everyone would cry tears of happiness at my funeralim tired of having to argue with myself  times a day that i can name atleast  person excluding my mother who would miss me if i died nowim tired of picturing someone beating the crap out of me or murdering me in horrible ways just to make myself feel better that i finally got what i deservedbut for the past  years things have been way worse it took a year to acknowledge that things have become worse it then took more than  months to contact the psychologist at the uni who is only available once every  weeks while i dont have enough money to pay for a private psychologist and my mind has been working overtime to torture me  weeks ago i fucked up while singing a different version of the happy birthday song to someone i know and i convinced myself that i ruined everyones lives that i have no skills or intelligence that i dont know how to be civil shouldve declined their invitation to join the party they were just being polite they didnt actually want me there since then ive been staying in bed almost all the time missing all classes all other events trying to avoid going to the supermarket till my supplies go bonedry every minute of every day i feel like i would be better off dead i cant find any happiness from the usual things i cant find any sort of purpose in life i only feel regret and pain about being alive every secondive been reading articles on this subreddit for more about  days now upto articles posted many months ago every time i read an article i feel so much pain and sadness that someone would feel so down and i wish beyond everything that someone would help them find their way again i also feel sad that i cannot help any of themmy question to myself mostly if noone else cares is when i can empathize with everyone here and feel the need to help them and also understand that they deserve a break from this monster thats depression why cant i give myself a fucking break,3.0

60010,i thought i was going to move up in the world so i had a job interview finally after a very long time of not having any my current job is shit they treat their employees terrible and the whole nine yards i could say alot but just check out the office depot subreddit for all of this shit that happens that we have to deal withanywayi go to the interview for a receptionist position and i fucking nail it the lady said you are a god send i thought for sure i was a shoein she said that they would call me for a second interview with the boss  i was on cloud nine  i thought i was going to move up in the world and finally find an employer that gave a shit about its employees i thought i could be someone how stupid of me i should have known betterthey called me for a second interview but they wanted to see a portfolio of my design work i took webgraphic design classes in college however i have done  real world design work aside from making lost dog posters and what have you at office depot luckily i was able to scrounge up some stuffi met the boss and he seems cool we start to go over my resume and portfolio i only had  examples  after i get done showing them to him he said is that it i nodded my head i slid my portfolio closer to him so he could flip through it at his leisure he looked at me like i was retarded he then asked if i had any websites that i built and if i could show him i havent build a websites since some final projects from my college classes which was roughly  years agoi told him that i didnt  i was pretty embarrassed he then said he was going to email me a mock order and i would design it if it was good hed call me back for a third interview  however i dont have photoshop illustrator or microsoft publisher on my home computer that software is at work and i use that stuff dailyat work clearly im going to be outclassed by the others who applied for that position so now here i am crippled with depression im a giant fucking failure of a person just stamp an l on my forehead i thought i was going to leave my shitty job i thought i was going to move up in the world and be someone that was stupid of my to think that as i see it im going to rot away at my current job until we file for bankruptcy then i will probably ultimately kill myself i guess ill go back to hoping i die while i sleep at night or die while going to work on my days off i lay in bed waiting to die of course there is more to my depression than this but it stings  i was filled with hope and joy but now its gone back to me being crippled with depression with thoughts of suicide running though my head i try and try but i can never better my life i wonder why i try so much sometimes if the result is the same,3.0

60074,my life is falling apart i had a great job that i loved the only problem is that it was in a country in europe while i come from asia i studied my masters in this country and got a job i work in the charity sector i lived there for  years in the meanwhile i met the most amazing man ever we got engaged last year in september so to extend my work visa the first condition was that i had to get a job that paid € a year i got another job where i worked and i got the pay i needed it seemed like the paper work for this permit was pretty straightforward i filled out the form till the last section it was about how this job was advertised the charity that i worked in advertised it on their website i applied for the job and had an interview and everything i was not just given this job under any circumstances i earned it now what the government wanted was this job to be advertised on very specific platforms like a national newspaper and radio for  weeks and a website for job seekers to give them the best chance to apply for this job i asked my workplace if they would be happy to advertise this job again i would apply for it or if they were happy to get in touch with the immigration department on my behalf since they are the biggest charity of that country and try to seek some help they out right refused i was given a letter that said that my job contract was only valid till  because that is the day my visa expired as well they would extend it if i got a valid visa extensioni went to a solicitor he said that i would waste around € on this visa application there was only a  chance that would get the visa i wont get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and i do not meet the criteria he asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if theyre willing to advertise it again they denied again my fiance and i dont necessarily have the money to get married right now it also does not feel right to get married just for a visa i know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married we decided to move to canada in  because he is from that european country hes okay in terms of canada visas he already got his visa my visa to his country expired in december  and i came back to my country after spending christmas with his family it was one of the hardest things i have had to do saying goodbye to my friends there my colleagues and the beautiful home my fiance and i lived in together i cannot get over how unjust this was i gave this charity everything i had for the last  years and all fucking hr could say was were so sorry i came back home to asia my life here is falling apart too my parents have lived in a love less marriage for  years now they hate each other each others families my dads been cheating on my mom for  years now we all know it my mother has the darkest circles under her eyes and her health has degraded so much in the past few years on the other hand my dad is progressing towards becoming a full blown alcoholic theyre finally separating im glad about it they stayed together all this time just to raise me and my brother and because of the what will people say mentality of the society we live in my family is falling apart though celebrating festivals will never be the same my brother and i wont have one permanent home anymore well always visit our parents separatelyi also have to borrow some money from my father to take to canada because what i had saved is not enough almost every day when my father is drinking i hear him talk on the phone to his relatives or friends accusing me of how i have made him spend all this money how he will never get it back how ive made him a poor man ive said it to him that i will start paying him back as soon as i start working my fiance is also back in his home country working and saving up for our move hes a brilliant partner he came to see me in my country for about  weeks he looks after me knows what im going through and hes always there to talk to me or just be sad with me i dont mind the distance between us its only for a few months but im hopeless about everything else in my life we started to plan our wedding we decided that well do it by the end of  after we have settled in canada with new jobs and everything but no i do not feel happy or excited about a single thing i know that i should be grateful i have my mom and my fiance and my best friend i know theyre always here for me but nothing is helpful nothing at all i dont see the light at the end of the tunnel my career is in shambles my parents are breaking up my home is breaking up my confidence my happiness my attitude everything has been broken down in the past few months theres something eating me up from the inside but i still dont feel like i can talk to anyone around me i cannot take it anymore ive hurt myself in the past and it scares me how good it actually feels im trying not to do it again all the things that i found happiness in before i simply dont now just getting out of bed is the hardest thing to do i try to sleep for most of the day it makes it less painful i dont know if ill ever feel better does it get better will it every get better someone please say yes please say that it will get better it has to i cant feel like this forever please make it stop,3.0

60141,i will stop feeling emotions so heres the deal recently i got this friend that turned into an so before she was in my life i was depressed as usual when i was still depressed before that im extremely smart btw and overanalyse everything i made what i call pessimisticly realistic predictions of the future the predictions were based on experience and always correct except it seemed this one time until she lost interest in me which i had predicted i tried to be friends afterwards but she had come to see my true colours and didnt like me enough to want to be like that i sunk back into a much much worse depression i was cutting and tried to kill myselfluckily i still had this one friend i thought i could trust who i shared my problems with which made me feel better and my depression was slowly receding on multiple occasions i asked if they were uncomfortable listening to me they said they werent fast forward a bit and im explaining a sad thought that i had and they say they dont want to talk anymore i guess they got tired of me or i said something offensive it was to do with themi was broken obviously but i had also predicted this and so was ready for it i had a plan to fix the problem which is unknown to me as of yet and to never have that problem again however in the case that they dont want to fix the problem i wont have anyone left and will need to stop myself from feeling emotions i am confident this because i have already forced myself to accept that relationships are not for me and that i cant ever trust my friends i also have a lack of empathy and can cope with being alone as i have in the pastthe reason for doing this is that if i dont im playing with my life like a hot potato because the mental pain will be too dangerous eventually the pain will get too much and ill drop the potatoi have also succeeded somewhat by imagining dam walls and emotions as fluids i only slip up a few times when the depression is too much to handle but i quickly stop itif this is the case i can focus on my future a lot better and achieve what i want to achieveim just really tired of investing my time and effort into people especially when im introverted just to have them make me think i can trust them and that they like me and then not like me and cause more depression than happinesshas anyone else here stopped themselves from feeling emotions,3.0

60159,journal entry with depressionanxiety throwaway but wrote some shit down in my notes and figured maybe some of you guys could relate to the thought patterns hope its okay to post just wanted to say something personalgtdays can go by without me saying anything to anyone no conversation no communication i feel like ive entered into a black hole im just spinning into perpetual darkness i wonder why chloe keeps showing up in my dreams its weird saying her name now especially since she inadvertently communicated i am not of equal relevance to her  so much time i spent thinking about what it would be like to be with her but who is she anyway shes right theres little significance in our knowing each other its mainly been onesided and was probably due to trauma that i experienced in which case i built a castle around her that she didnt need rescuing from i said it in my dream last night so ill say it again theres something that i love about myself in chloe theres an image that seems so integral to my past  a part of me thats brave strong and courageous could only unlock something so beautiful and composed i think its more appropriate to separate the real chloe from the archetype of chloe i sound like such a creep honestly though that makes me think more about what if shes really just an amazing person and the part of her rejecting me is because she clearly sees im not whatever female sensory faculties she has must detect that i am weak inadequate and emasculated too early by the complexity of life what a shitty thought i guess ill never know that answer either way probably best to keep the first thought trail going because the archetype is less offensive to me its understandable to some degree because it hurts less to be rejected by an archetype rather than a person the archetype i can disconnect from emotionally and even credit myself for my poor behavior well enough to say im just not ready for that type of woman yet its more approachable also probably a defense mechanism or selfpreservation instinct i dont think i wanna talk about it anymore it pisses me off i really thought id have something down pat at  but suddenly im just here its like taking a test you were unprepared for and then suddenly realizing halfway youre about to flunk this bitch thats my life now i dont even like listening to myself write because its all nonsensical selfdeprecating bullshit hilarious that my depression seems to be like a smug movie critic fuck that guy  my thoughts dont quit though i keep hearing our dog in the white noise of my room that loud incessant highpitch of a bark auditory hallucinations are probably stressrelated or im just borderline schizophrenic thats a scary thought i dont see anything though and god forbid i ever do just that barking shit that trips me out from time to time i didnt eat much today i had some crackers and thats about it depression is in full swing again im finding it hard to be motivated to do anything dude fuck the money i got from christmas ive already spent so there goes those little micro feelings of possibility that i had just the simple stuff like having a few bucks to go get some food having a little money is like a mental safety net or proponent of options now theres none i really wanna fucking cry i keep thinking about suicide a lot i just want it to end but then i dont i want the misery and the pain and the anxiety and the voice of my own criticism to be over i wanna wake up in another world but i dont think im going to heaven i could be wrong if god is real maybe theres some pity hes reserved for me am i really a dirty piece of shit sinner or has deeprooted trauma and emotional abuse turned into nihilism either way i cant unsee the worlds coldness and indifference towards me i want the show of the funeral to see what people would say if i just died but theres no guarantee id even get that closure and how sad what would people even think theres literally so many unanswered questions about me i cant even wrap my head around it it makes me sick this is not cathartic to me at all i just wanna say i dont know who said writing or journaling is a good thing for you seeing how im all over the place overly sensitive and depressed doesnt make me feel like im problem solving here its just a record of shit thats never going to be said or communicated i just dont fucking know anymore that sentence is everything i just dont fucking know anymore im attacked on all fronts by my mind i cant fucking do this shit and im angry why the fuck did i have to grow up so incompetent why am i so angry didnt i do this to myself theres a part of me thats rioting though im mad that i realize now most of my early twenties was trying to appease god but i got in the way i couldnt not fuck shit up it just got more difficult and more difficult im such a disaster of a person and sure a part of me might swoop in and say no youre not that bad off no think about all the other people and how much worse off you could have it i know i know i know but it doesnt deter the reality of the pain i am actually going through and waking up with and spending hours on hours restless in my bed at hours like this i cant even cry but what does that solve anyway i fucking hate myself and this is just a real portrayal of that you need help sam yeah well no one is going to fucking help me no one gets it i was on a quest for something and i fucking failed i shouldve taken a left when i went right or vice versa whichever fuck way if its not cathartic than why do i keep writing maybe ill take that back im scared of whats next ive locked myself away for so long how does one dig themselves out of something like this you dont that suicide stuff was hard to say i feel like saying it hurts that part of me that was once a child im sorry i want good things i just dont know how to get there anymorelt,3.0

60603,can you be in a relationship when youre depressed hello as the title suggests im wondering if a person is able to be in a relationship when they are depressed i currently have a boyfriend that is struggling with depression and it seems like it is hard for him to be happy and i dont feel like i am able to make him happy when he is depressed i wouldnt say he is depressed all the time but it seems like his periods of depression are increasing in length and are happening more frequently he has started going to counseling to work on this but i understand it takes time i personally was very depressed for years when my mom passed away but would say i rarely struggle with depression now so i get where he is coming from i just feel like i cant help or i keep doing the wrong thing so friends of reddit do you think its possible to be in a relationship when depressed when youre incapable of doing basic tasks let alone put effort into a relationship is this something i should stick around and help him with or is he better off alone to sort out his depression so that can be his some focus is there anything that i could be doing to help him what would you want from your sothank you,3.0

60733,its never bad until its really bad this is just my story but also a question is there anyone else that feels this wayi was diagnosed a few months ago with major depression recurrent ive had depressive episodes at least once a year and usually twice or three times since as long as i can remember when i was five i had major surgery that traumatized me and i guess i never fully recovered id always thought that being sad all the time was just my personality i would read about depression and think yeah but mines not that bad sort of like living in a world where its overcast every day it never rains and its never sunny so you just get used to it and figure thats the way things will always be over the last three years my depressive episodes got increasingly worse they lasted longer and were more severe but i always thought that they would go away after a few weeks and generally this was true id return to my normal sad self after a while so i figured it was just normal like tides or seasons or something in the spring of last year i had my worst depressive episode ever it got to the point where i felt guilty just eating lunch i felt like i deserved to starve deserved to be alone deserved to live in a messy apartment with moldy food in the fridge etc etc i figured it would go away after a few weeks but it just got worse i was in grad school at the time and decided to take a year off and go back home i saw a doctor and he prescribed  of sertraline zoloft after about six weeks it was like i could see color and had been living my entire life in black and white before that people told me i was a totally different person when i went to bed i always thought yeah that was a good day even if it was nothing special i was surprised and mistrusting of this newfound happiness i thought maybe it wouldnt last but my therapist and i convinced myself it was the new normal about a month into this i had my wisdom teeth removed it was traumatic in several ways but i will just say to anyone reading who has depression please look up the side effects of inflammation and opiates on people with depression so you can be prepared when i wasnt anyway after that things started to go back to how they had been not bad but not great some days i would go to bed thinking it was a good day but most days i wouldnt i increased my dose to  and didnt feel anything now i suppose ill ask to increase it again i just wish i could understand is this a real disease could it really be treated is happiness a temporary hallucination things arent bad now theyre fine but thats how theyve always been just fine and then something happens and theyre not fine theyre bad am i asking too much to live better than just fine i think some people see depression as this big thing that ruins your life but what if youve had it all your life and all that time you were figuring out how to live with it sometimes i wish someone would just say oh yeah youre just sad get on with it but my brief experience of happiness—motivation satisfaction contentment emotion—leads me to believe there is a better life i could have i asked my mom a while back do normal people go to bed each day thinking yeah that was a good day she said yes i cant stop thinking about how thats such a small thing it should be easy for me to do it sounds so simple anyway thanks for reading ill just keep on going hoping things get better but ive lived so long thinking that this is it that just fine is just normal i dont know if i truly hope things will get better does anyone else feel this wayif i knew that other people had this experience and maybe got out of it i dont know—maybe that would be the thing that convinces me to keep trying and keep hoping,3.0

60736,wish i knew how to deal with it ive struggled with depression and constant anxiety  social anxiety for a large portion of my life ive had very few friends mainly due to being backstabbed twice and have very little trust for people due to being emotionally and sexually manipulated im not gonna write too much i booked an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow morning but im so worried to talk to the psychiatrist i have to be in a call on my phone with the camera facing me ive been holding off talking to a psychiatrist for that sole reason that i have to talk to them face to face my social anxiety has always been bad but never at home ive never been afraid to talk over the phone or over the internet until recently i got in to a relationship with someone whos amazing and super loving my issue is ive never been truly loved before neither have i truly loved someone else it has brought me so many positive emotions but possibly even more negative ones that im unable to deal with hence contacting the psychiatrist i no longer only struggle with irl social anxiety i now struggle with it online too i can no longer be in voice calls i just dont know what to do anymore my only safe space is no longer safeim just looking for someone to talk to someone to convince me talking to the psychiatrist over the phone will go okay and convince me it will help because every time ive tried to make contact i end up cancelling the meeting because im too anxious to talk please help,3.0

60760,please ignore this  following my previous thing there was a few other things i wanted to touch on that i could not things like whether i wanted it to be better or not whether i could have fixed some issues or not during my teen years i had some issues here and there i wasnt the brightest child in fact i was believed to be the grossiest kid while others cared about their studies i care to get friends the friends i had were those that would not think twice before disposing of me knowing this i still stayed their disposable pawn if i had known beforehand that i would still be this sad darn i have alot of friends now friends that are kind straightforward understanding or even friends i can relate to people like them always find ways to help me but the most common way they do so is by saying you are still young saying that always makes me feel like i need to grow up sooner but in fact what is growing up its not like i have yet to tried growing up right whats so good about it either doesnt everyone want to stay young you can fake grow by acting matured act is not the truth you can act but it doesnt mean much i know my flaws im rude sensitive i blame but i dont show much anyways if you asked me i wont be my friend gloomy always depressing friends with emo kids they say you have to love yourself before you love others thats impossible for me i will possibly never ever find a day where i can love myself but i can hope i can influence others to not hate themselves ironic how i want to help others before myself ironic how im saying this i know life is sentimental i dont get some things adults do nor do adults get some things i do growing up is what they all call it it is not the act of being sensible that makes you grow it is the fact that you listen to others expand your horizons and reflect reject insults and be yourself until then i shall be the same i dont want to change for people who do not change themselves i changed a lot i became someone who is the funny person out of many others who seemed more childish than i was i did try to show myself as different from them but they never once did think of me as mature im writing this to see how many flaws i have as a being also as to see how useless i am basically im still young and im hating on the world being an adult surely life doesnt always go ones way either you can have a good job but not love what you do you can have your favourite job but not what stables your lifestyle all these depressing songs from hatsume miku gumi ia and lumi i can relate to most of them and thats not what i want to show here i do not want to show that my life has been boring its not like being lonelys the thing i chose since the start right i tried everything i could but cant see the end you tell me everything ive been doing was all for naught what are you my savior my hater you dont have the rights to call the shots now do you but no obviously people who can voice out tend to have more influence or else everything will move awkwardly the classes in schools cant function properly take for example the song irony i cant seem to walk anymore symbolizes the fact that you do not feel like you can do it anymore the songs basically about how you have friends but your not happy i can relate to it but mines different i have caring friends they helped me alot but my case now cant be helped by simply words nor do i actually want to confide in them they might brush it off or lose my trust i dont trust easily thanks to some incidents that happened a while ago i no longer try to find someone to love as they dont deserve it there are good people i get but the people i dont like always seems to get more influence towards me i am so weak to the point i cant even cry therefore ranting to anyone whos reading this sad story of mine i lie so much when i say i dont want anyone to see this or i lie so much that im lying about this i dont get this life either i was born short i dont see any meaning in life wheres my special talent the fact i can elaborate my pains like this whats the point anyone can do that with a little practice for anyone who thinks im pitiful should just not do anything i dont want your pity not to be rude or anything i had enough of pities im sensitive to rude remarks and i take my lies that i cant retrieve to my grave which is why i dont want friends i mistreat them my conscience wont allow my ignoring them i can not see the end of the road and it seems like it always stops halfway for me people who do not want me to die they are good people who in turn actually weights my burdens further to the point i have to fake a smile or two to calm when i cannot even calm myself down i talk big like how i can thrash others in fights when i have yet to had a real fight im thrash in every generation there ought to be thrashes and im one of them you can tell me ill be fine i know that myself but its too long the fact im ranting is to hopefully ease myself anyways so it is not like ill suddenly be okay all of a sudden i do not expect this depressing life of mine to be better lovefriendshiprespecttrustfeelings things that shapes life i dont got none my feelings are like manifested from my cheerful thoughts and my real feelings are hidden behind my smile which is the suicidal self i know i talk big about how i always want to suicide but it is not okay for me to just burden down my classmates friends family right see im just making up excuses now that i cant kill myself im a useless cunt who cant save his own sorrows for himself and rants on reddit out of this whole world im not the only one suffering from depression in fact most of the world population is you can ease ones depression but you are depressed yourself and need help its like a trauma you cant solve just by adding a few words here and there for me words dont add feels to me anymore actions might who knows im so broken i think ill laugh maniacally if someone asks me if im okay  sorry for anyone who had to read through this to kill time or what sorry to kill the mood sorry for apologising sorry for being a burden sorry for wasting your time sorry for being so useless sorry for being so depressing i dont know what to do with this weak life of mine anyways,3.0

60871,i feel like a horrible mother ive been so stressed out lately because the father of my child is being investigated for child porn i went crazy for the first couple weeks thinking my child had been molested or out in the internet by someone i was willingly giving him to every other weekend after a forensic analysis  the fbi determined that my son didnt reveal anything and that he doesnt show any signs of trauma i do feel relieved but im still just absolutely sick and honestly just not feeling good at all my mind has wandered to the worst places at times i feel like life isnt even real and that this is all a jokei dont feel good about parenting anymore i feel like i cant trust myself or my judgement im feeling a lot of the things i feel like my mental health problems are being triggered to the max my ptsd and bpd i feel like im not a good enough mother i even told my son that tonight after i yelled at him for never listening to me or doing what hes told fighting me and mouthing me which in turn just makes it even worse his dad has been torn from his life and now his mom is showing weakness in her stress and saying things that are possibly damaging and could make him more insecure and sad i truly am trying my hardest to be strong and im doing everything i need to make sure my son is okay and will be okay he was sobbing in his room because i just yelled and left him there alone after i realized what id done i apologized for not making the bet choices and expressed how much he means to me and that things are hard for me right now that just makes me feel manipulative and toxic the worst thing that could happen to my son now is losing me yet i feel like im not good enough for him like he deserves better i dont know what to do im manic im estranged from everyone right now ive been therapy since way before this im trying my best to be happy and healthyi feel like its not good enough i feel like im not a good person i hate myself i hate life i hate everyone and everything i find very little joy anymore just my son considering all my thoughts about being toxic to him makes me feel sad for him more than anything i dont know what to do,3.0
60872,pushing myself everyday i recently moved out of home for the first time in an attempt to step away from my family because there were a lot of abusive and harsh situations i was then lucky enough to score a rely great job as a bartended for a rely successful company and i enjoy it greatly then recently my roomates introduced me to a friend and then her and i went on a few dates over a few weeks and rely hit it off well it was the first time i let myself get close to someone since my ex and i ended over a year ago all the situations and dramas i handled over the last few years i handled on my own i knew i had something wrong with my head because i would have some days where i never wanted to leave my room but i kept overcoming those issues and pushing myself to get better and kept quiet about my internal struggles because of that ive pushed people away and honestly dont have any family or friends to fall back on after a few stressful  but managable shifts at work i see this girl again and we have sex for the first time and i felt attatched like an idiot then about a day later she texts me saying she doesnt want anything right now and just wants to be friends i completely understood it and didnt want to pressure her into anything she didnt want and it was left at that now im left with  days off with no one to fall back and talk to no family to rely on and on top of it all i let myself get attatched to quickly and am left feeling stupid and alone with my thoughts i want to overcome this but everytime i overcome something i feel like theres another struggle around the corner i feel lost i dont have a question im not looking for feedback i just needed to put these thoughts somewhere and i thought why not to a bunch of strangers im sorry for any grammar issues this hasnt been the easiest to type thankyou,3.0

60896,i dont know what im doing with my life background on me im  years old a transgender female depressed i have add and im living with a friend and her aunt because my parents didnt support me in being trans and began emotionally abusing me so i had to leave their house i work at subway somewhat full time but it really isnt enough to live off ofi feel like crap most of the time i hate myself and i feel like a failure to most everyone in my life i dont know what im going to do with my life i need to get a better job but i have no college and if i go to college i will flunk and be in the same spot now except more debt so college is out of the question so basically i feel so lazy at work i ask people if they think im lazy or i dont work very hard and they say im fine but i do slack on the job a lot and when i come home i just go to my room and play video games or watch youtube or basically be a reclusive introvert my friends aunt who is basically my landlady took me in and said i dont owe her rent recently she has been saying that she wants me to pay rent which is totally fine but she is also angry because i dont really interact with her much but the reason i dont is because im scared and i feel so awkward when i do i have almost no motivation to do anything except work so looking for another job is a huge task for meim a christian too so this paragraph will be mostly about that stuff so feel free to skip for whatever reason if you want i feel like ive failed god because i dont go to church anymore really my relationship with jesus is like the most important thing to me but i feel like i only talk the talk without walking the walk none of my friends or family approve of my transition to female but it is something that i need to do or ill probably kill myself in the near future i dont pray i dont read my bible all i think about is being a freaking girl or video games i dont give god even  minute of my day i am a garbage human and an even worse christian i know there is no such thing as a bad christian but this is how i feelall i eat is junk food and subway sandwiches because when im hungry i dont feel like making anything i just want to eat something yummy and screw my body i dont like my disgusting male body anyways so i dont really feel a desire to care for it i am absolutely governed by my feelings what feels good now whats fun whats tasty etc i dont do anything hard in my life unless it benefits me or i need to i hate that part of myself but i dont know any way to combat that i dont really hang out with friends because i almost never initiate and i dont have a car or a license so i have to bum rides off of people and so i feel like crap for thatso basically i feel like a garbage human and a waste of space i didnt ask to be put on this hellride called life and if i had it my way id just want to get off life is a horrible evil place and i absolutely abhor existence at least mine thank you so much for taking the time to read all my problems sorry it has to be so negative  this is where im at right now when people ask how i am i wish i could respond with im horrible actually because i hate lying through my teeth every time ,3.0

60917,just a rant im  pretty sure i suffer from depression even though i havent seen a doctor for it i peaked in hs super athletic guy thought i was super cool for getting with multiple girls and talk to multiple girls at the same time met my current wife right before i graduated took a leap of faith and got married to her after a year of dating i had a great job opportunity overseas turned it down to get married and took a job state side usa over the course of  years of being married i have gained  pounds became super self conscious with myself and have felt just sad i binge eat all the time now knowing its bad and that i should go workout and get fit but i have no motivation at all im constantly late to work because i just want to sleep an extra  minutes while making a dumb excuse up to my boss every single day i know i love my wife but some days i think the only thing keeping together our marriage is our son i love him more than anything and i know she does too but she always wants to go out with her girlfriends and drink and party together i have no motivation to do that and always stay home with my son i think she sees her friends doing this all the time and she wishes she could live that life style more often but feels held down since she is a mom i know something is probably wrong with me and something is contributing to my lack of drive or motivation but i just dont want to see a doctor for it i have never considered self harm although i have thought that death would make everything for everyone around me better just wanted to rant a little bit as i sit at work thanks to anyone who decides to read this entire thing  ,3.0

61025,afraid to go back down the hole im almost  ive been on track for  years but really  years of actual health i struggle daily with the fear of going back to where i was before this  years anything that i cant control gives me anxiety i avoid a lot of things social interaction is limited to a couple of friends and my family despite this this period of time has been a god send as many of you might understand now you know the expression when it rains it pours i feel like when youre dealing with depression it really pours even when it drizzles i had been excited to make some changes career wise and even considered going back to school suddenly i im starting to panic and find myself really struggling i knew it was just the changes that were coming such as moving back in with my mom in order to make school happen financially but at the same time im terrified because thats where i let go completely last time after i moved back in after college im aware this is different im aware it shouldnt be the same but its like listening to an old love song as this transition is getting closer and closer im also having to deal with a few other expensive bumps in the road its frustrating because my family doesnt understand why im so overwhelmed by it all it will pass dont worry about it its hard to explain what its really like in my head and in my chest im mostly afraid of going backwards thats the part im struggling with the most i know im not  obviously i feel like no one can ever really get back to  because you will always remember what it was like im just not feeling in control anymore does anyone else deal with these life after depression feels,3.0

61136,depressed girlfriend broke up with me my ex girlfriend   suffers from depression and she was honest since the beginning of our  relationship ive been supportive and caring and she was great we were  together for  months and everything seemed to go great but she  started on a new medication two weeks ago and she was on a roller  coaster of emotions then when she was assimilating the new medication  she would be more stable but started being grumpy at me and i thought i  was triggering this mood on her i know i shouldnt take this personal  because people with depression do this not in purpose but cant help it  but i was trying to understand her and support her anyway there was  this time where after watching movies with her and having a great day  she cries and i just hug her until she calms down and then we talkedshe  told me that shes sorry for the way shes treating me that she thinks  it is the medication but it is odd because the medication shes taking  now actually helps her depression but she feels grumpy at me only and  she doesnt know why she doesnt want to hurt me and i deserve someone  better then she said that she needed some space to work on herself and  clear her mind because she feels she cant give her all in our  relationship i told her lets not make a decision tonight because our  heads are hot and we cant think clearly lets talk tomorrow and after  that i stayed at hers for a little while and she kissed me and  hugged me then i leftnext day we talked and we decided to take a break and we set some boundaries were  on a break for a month with no physical contact for a week after the  week she will see if she wants to see me once twice or more times a  week also after the month we will talk again and we will discuss  whether she needs more time wants to get back together or we break up her  goal is to work on herself and love herself more my goal is to  reassess our relationship think about the implications that having a  depressed partner implies pros and cons and our final outcome is to get  back together in a strong relationship we are not seeing other people as in dates or romantic relationships or casual encounters we are faithful to each otherwell  we discussed that and after agreeing on that we went to my place and we  had sex for the last time then she left and we started this break it  was saturday i did  everything of what we agreed but on monday i couldnt take it anymore  and i just texted her im missing you  and she replied aw hope  youre doing well   can we speak this friday after your work and  i replied sure i thought i made a mistake and i was feeling so  anxious and i was counting the days hours minutes seconds for that  friday to come also i was kind of expecting the worst because she told  when we started dating that her last relationship was two months ago  before meeting me so i thought she was also having second thoughts in  our relationship because she might still be in love with her ex and she  was using me to heal but she realized she couldnt i didnt know what  to do i was going crazy then i started thinking straight and i thought  ok she has always told me she loves me and she demonstrated her love  before she went to this crisis so the idea of her having still feelings  for her ex disappearedthen on  tuesday the  after  days of our break and before ending the first  week of no physical contact she texted me if she could come over to mine  to speak and i replied sure i was extremely nervous and anxious  thinking omg shes going to break up with me i love her so much and i  am willing to be with her regardless of her mental illness but i think  she will dump me i could not stop thinking about that and then she  arrives i open the door and kiss her and she didnt dodge it so i was  like ok she didnt avoid my kiss so i think its good newswe  went then for a walk and when we started talking she starts crying  and telling that she loves me so much i am the best thing that ever  happened to her that she hopes i never change because i am a great  person and was a great boyfriend and she will never forget the short but  beautiful time we spent togetherthen  she said she is really sorry for how things were going but at the  moment she is not ready for a romantic relationship that she needs some  time by herself to discover herself and focus on her mental healthi  was devastated and insisted on my support to her and tried to make her  change her mind but i couldnt and finally i accepted i was calm and  showing strength before her but deep inside i was crying we hugged and  kissed for the last time the last time i will feel her soft skin the  last time i will hold her in my arms the last time i will kiss her  lips it was really hardi  offered her my friendship and unconditional support but she refused and  told me that i can talk to her parents anytime i need to they are  there for me because they really appreciate me i was feeling like  someone stabbed my chest and when she refused my friendship it was like  the knife went deeper into my chestthen  she left and i went back home and sat on the couch without moving  thinking feeling anything for about  minutes after that i broke  down and cried the whole nightafter  two days she texted me asking how i was and i told her that im  alright still missing her but slowly getting better and asked her as  well how was she she said she was emotional but glad that i was getting  betterthen i told her again  that she doesnt need to push me away that i can give her the time she  needs but we can still continue our relationship but she reaffirmed her  decision of being just by herselfi  wont insist anymore but i wish after this new medication settles down  on her we come back together i know its hard to have a depressed  partner but i really love her and i am okay with that but also if she  doesnt want a romantic relationship with me anymore i hope we can still  be friends i really want to support her even as friendsim  missing sleeping with her being with her talking with her laughing  with her im missing all the good times we had together,3.0

61235,your worst experience with psychiatric medication hi everyone i was diagnosed with chronic depression at the age of  now at  i have a couple scary experiences with medication to begin i was diagnosed with add and given daytrana patches these things made me lose my ever loving mind my eyes would glass over and i would flip out i got in a physical altercation with my mom screamed that i was going to murder my sister and even lost it on a teacher i was a very easy going person beforehand but daytrana triggered something in me and lead to me being baker acted my mental health recovered a lot but ever since then i have a mood disorder and depressionbad experience  with wellbutrin came many years later in  im a   pound woman and was prescribed  mgs of the stuff yes  damn milligrams thats a lot for someone my size i had just entered what would become to be an abusive relationship with a man who turned out to be a sociopathic rapist this  the ungodly amount of medication i was on went about how youd expect i went  batshit crazy to the point of developing a minor case of psychosis i would lose my mind on everyone and i would scream at my parents that there was nothing they could do to save me and that i was going to die before my  birthday me and this psychopath boyfriend got in an argument and he called me and threatened to rape me and leave my body in a ditch my parents thankfully had my car keys because i was about to go to his house and burn it to the ground with kerosene i confronted my psychiatrist about my aggression and she denied that wellbutrin could make me this way but i explained the situation to my primary care physician and the first thing she asked was youre on wellbutrin arent you yes finally someone confirmed it for me i later met a   pound war veteran who was on  mgs of the stuff and he said that he would go into blind rages and throw furniture while on it now if  mgs can do that to a huge man imagine what  mgs did to me a woman who has to crawl on the counter to get things off of shelves i thankfully got off the stuff after  months of believing that my mental illness had finally won and that id be like that for the rest of my life it wasnt me at all my incompetent psychiatrist screwed me over something fierce as for the boyfriend i left him and decided to stop dating so what about yall have you ever had a bad experience with psychiatric meds,3.0

61359,resources amp ideas for those struggling with the  lockdowns and isolation hi everyone  gosh has everything gotten crazy with all these countries and places being closed down locked down and forbidden social contact ive read sooooo much about people struggling and panicking about what to do now that social life has been removed  i struggle with severe depression and anxiety and just came out of a horrible episode recently  only to also be shut down and isolated again by all this madness anyway my heart goes out to everyone struggling with this like i am  some of you are having an even worse time than me too and i want to remind you youre not alone here are some ideas and things all of us can try to do together to stay on top of this isolation situation and stay away from suicide as an option i know for a fact that these options cannot cure anything and this is not a complete listplease add your own ideas in the comments too  we can do this guys  if were isolated hundreds of thousands of other people are too lets go find them thank god for the internet  we are not alone  lets use each other here on reddit andor other online forums and options  stay online keep talking stay connected  we are not alone  play video games  its kind of like reading a book without the kind of mental attention that it takes to read  just go through the motions  try to lose yourself in it a little bit and try making friends online through online multiplayer or something  dont have money there are thousands of free ones  dont have a console use your computer dont have a computer use your phone    join another forum or online community  there are options here on reddit and one google search of online communities will give you a hundred more  most of the time theyre completely free and many are anonymous if thats your thing  lets go meet people and talk about whats going on and how we can all relate to being sad about being stuck inside    instead of true video games you can also play just simpler games online with other people and chat while doing it  online checkers chess words with friends card games  easy to learn lots of people to meet probably some friends here that will join you on one of those games or sites too heck knows i would invite me anybody else have more ideas  please share  anyway i hope this helps  we can do this guys its gonna be okay  cue my irrational anxiety trying to tell me otherwise and me trying to beat it away with an imaginary broom lol,3.0

61375,my dad just left my life ive been dealing with depression since i was in my early teens diagnosed and medicated for years then i stopped taking my pills since i was a kid all ive ever asked of my father was to call and talk to me more than birthday and christmas everytime id bring it up things would get better for awhile hed call more often having that would cheer me up but after anywhere from a month to three months he would go back to usual and it would hurt me well recently i told him i was tired of having to ask and he basiclly told me tough shit it has really had a negative impact on my depression and i just needed to vent this out thanks reddit for me never having to ask for you to be here,3.0
61376,my mom doesnt like me and it is really contributing to my depression i think somewhere in there she loves me but she doesnt like me she doesnt want to talk to me or be my friend she never reaches out to make plans if i didnt initiate things we would never see each other her and my dad live together so when him and i make plans i will see her and go say hi and bye i always feel like im interupting her tv program when i do if i try to initiate plans with her in person and that usually works a little walk or brunch or a movie i text her though and she never replies even to just the simple i love you or miss you i feel guilty complaining about this she wanted a child so bad they tried for years to have me she had a miscarriage before me i feel like a disapointment like i didnt turn out the way she wanted and so now shes changed her mind i hate feeling like thissome women do not deserve children i know that might sound harsh but no one deserves to feel the way she makes me feel she makes me feel like i ruined her dream i know she is most likely depressed just like me but fuck man this shit just hurts today is her birthday and i was feeling bad because i have to work all day and wont have time to see her then i remembered that she doesnt try to see me or call or text on my birthday so i guess i have nothing to feel nad about i shot her a text it will be ignored as usuali just wanted to get this out somewhere i feel guilty complaining about this because i know her and my dad did their best to raise me but i am not grateful to be here i am terribly depressed and question my existence at every turn i feel like i am just a product of regretful baby fever they were too stupid to realize that i might not come out the way they wanted my dad has accepted me my mom cannotthe only thing i have going for me right now is to try and live my best life out of spite so maybe one day she will see how happy i am and want a peice and i will be there to give her the same shit energy she gives me now ☹🙁😔,3.0

61378,ive been depressed so long i just feel empty ill start this off by saying that its almost  am and ive been up all day so whatever i end up posting might be a little confusing and also im on mobile so excuse my garbage formatting basically ive been consistently depressed since i was in the  grade i had a friendcrush that was depressed self harming and suicidal that i would support and at this point i was fine mentally one day she posts on whatever social media we used at the time that she had picked a date for her suicide which of course freaked me out i ended up telling my mom who told the school who told her parents and she got admitted into the mental health ward at our local hospital that was the last time she spoke with me because of what she probably saw as a betrayal of trust i know it did the right thing but ive never really put that story out there and it feel its important since it the moment i started to fall into a depression for anyone wondering she is alive and well from what i can tell we ended up at the same high school so i know shes alive fast forward to now and im an almost  yo male with no real skills recently had to cut off every single one of my friends long story and i have no aspirations or skills to speak of i know its a young age to be saying that im screwed but anxiety makes it hard to want to go out and learn anything and even if that wasnt in the way i just dont care about anything enough to do it i just sit at home and find something to waste my time during the day so that i can sleep repeat not really sure what the point of this post even is i guess its just some way of getting shit off my chest after being fully alone for the last  months if you made it this far in sorry you had to endure this post but thanks for sticking with it i guess,3.0

61642,same person who i helped rebuild their relationship with their best friend just told me he forgot about me so it was around the start of last semester and my friend had a falling out with another friend of ours and she said she didnt want to see him againthe friend who i ended up helping had gotten drunk a lot and had acted irresponsibly while inebriated  he is generally a docile and good person if a little quiet but when he drinks he kinda turns into an ass  he has been best friends with this girl since freshman year and we are currently in second semester senior year  the girl has struggled with her selfimage for most of her life and knowing this my drunk friend thinks it would be funny to scoff at her about her insecurities  she took it very personally and thus decided to completely avoid him for  weeks until i decided to step in   this girl is also my girlfriend and whenever i tried to suggest i help my friend to apologize she told me that he had to do it on his own accord so i wanted to help him since day   but i couldnt take it anymore  i didnt want to see a friendship that was so close fall apart because the guy decided to mope in his room instead of take initiative and apologize himself  she would tell me she couldnt believe he would hurt her like that and he would always be asking me whether or not she still talked about him and if she still hated him and it eventually got to the point where i couldnt fucking take it anymore  i had to help for their sake therefore against my gfs wishes i told him ways that i have previously apologized to her when i messed up and i supported him and told him when she was around so he could plan to meet her and have a talk with her while i stepped out for the moment  the process leading up to the actual confrontation between him and her took about  weeks and the whole time he was saying how he appreciated me and that i was such a great friend  but no one except him knows i helped him  everyone thinks he just did it himself and improved himself and im not saying he didnt grow at all through this process but its safe to say if i hadnt done anything he wouldnt have mended the relationship fast forward to earlier tonight around midnight  i dont really like the party scene and decide to stay home for the night while my friends went out to celebrate  days before graduation  when they came back shitfaced the first thing my friend says to me is oh anon i completely forgot about you after saying that he was sad another friend of mine didnt go with them  i want to give him the benefit of the doubt that hes just drunk but hearing that ive been forgotten from someone ive sunk so much time into helping kinda sucks thanks prick  ill remember that next time you have friend problems  not like ive struggled with social anxieties my whole life or anything  ,3.0

61783,ive become so disappointingly good at deceiving people every time i try to touch upon how much im suffering im quickly reminded that ive managed to convince everyone that im okay this goes beyond just having made too many jokes about wanting to kill myself ive been homeless for a few months now mainly sleeping on the floors and sofas of my friends houses but somehow they all still buy the narrative that im just super chill and lazy and weird i treat it like its funny so they do too i cant act for shit but when it comes to masking my own thoughts and feelings it somehow comes out perfectly i cant even imagine honestly answering them if they ever gave me concerned questions i just want support,3.0

61785,i hope someone else can wear the smile i never will i hope that my suffering is not in vain i wish nobody else would have to endure this that i could be the atlas of dysphoria a sponge of depression sadly i will always be a directionless mortal soul purposelessly afflicted as we all are i am grade  or a senior in high school  this is my grad year my triumph my departure from a way of life which was no less familiar to me for the past twelve years than my left and rightone could be consoled by their lack of maturity the auspices of a better future or a brighter perception  many would be quick to dismiss my plight scoff at it at naivete and move along  but pain sees no lines of age or maturity suffering corrupts all it shall touch and brings even the purest souls into bouts of confusion and melancholy  no concept of a better future holds promise as i  we all  live in the present moment experience the present pains respond to the present commitments of lifeand even so what delusion would fool someone into thinking that a  sacrifice or more of their fragile mortal life would ever be satisfactory in the hopes of a future slightly less fraught by hardship  but only possiblyour clever intuition would tell us and the same intuitive brain which so coincidentally induced this very malaise upon us at that that there is no better time than the present to take these concerns headon because why wouldnt we just expedite the process if it were so simplebut any veteran of depression will always recognise a flaw in this philosophy  our dilemmas will never be so simple  they will always render themselves so very elusive always stand insurmountable in spite of the most valiant feats of sheer willthe fact of the matter is this depression likely arose for a reason a reason that the sufferer couldnt conquer a reason that has left the sufferer stuck and despondentno matter how many fiends i slay the projections of this insuperable beast manifest doubly like a hydra  my resolve coups of willpower only serve to agitate the monster  it would seem that the only guarantee is the efficacy of my ability to palliate the malady but never remedy it  sadly i can only turn my back to the hydra and hope that one day he shall see the end of his days and that that day comes before mine doesso today i feign a smile  today i bandage the sores and turn my blind eye towards them  today i hope that things get better  someone might invite me to a party someone might flirt with me someone might confide with me and hear my voice or someone might see me as an equalbut today i know that things wont  i know that i am trapped in the demon of my inescapable sorrow a prisoner to misfortune  and yet this foul beast eschews traditional logic for his sole purpose is to torment  my thoughts bleed with confusion my eyes blunt with sadness yet i cant even fake emotionthree months from now i undergo one of the quintessential marks of graduation i will confront my primordial fear of prom night  i was always naive to think that the solution was to simply forgo it in ignorant denial to think that this solution could somehow satisfy my humble desire of happinessi was wrong  my friends whom i thought could sink in this boat with me together have found their dates and onceunseen social skills  but maybe its providence and maybe my childhood entourage had always been thwarted by my anchorage  maybe it was inevitable that the captain would eventually sink the ship in solitude while the others found their timely retreat away from the wreckage  maybe it was my naivete which brought me to expect the obedience of a crew of longing misfits to stand by as i manoeuvred us into a darkening storm,3.0

61989,my boyfriend broke up with me due to depression can someone help me understand if this makes it any easier im a  yo female and hes a  yo maleshort storywe have been together  year it started out amazing then he started a job he hated and he started changing seemed unhappy we moved in together after  months at the worst time during his anxietydepression he broke up with me very suddenly i couldnt understand he broke down and said he wanted to be alone he seemed upset about us breaking up and still loves me but needs to be alone i cant understand and i want help understanding read questions belowlong storyive been with my boyfriend for almost a year we had an amazing relationship to start with he was so fun and exciting had so many hobbies and loved doing sports with me he started a full time job doing an engineering qualification and ever since being put on site i noticed a change in him he hates his job and wants to go travelling again he has been abroad for the past  years and he wanted to go back out again which was something we wanted to do he lost his energy and spark stopped talking about us travelling winter came and he seemed to lose interest in everything we spent more time watching tv instead of having adventures like we used to before this all happened we already decided to move in together i believe we moved in at the worst timeit got a little tense with this quarantining and although he was very affectionate still loved cuddling being close saying he loved me sex etc he lacked ability to show his love in other ways i always left him notes or went out of my way to show him i was there for him and i guess i wasnt getting much back so i started getting frustrated then arguments happened not loads but definitely noticeably more and i believe the quarantine situation made it worse our relationship was very fast moving and head first we moved in together after  months and spent almost all our time together before that  months down the line of living together we have to quarantinehe hasnt been right for a couple months now and i can see that and its brought me down that i cant make him happy he broke up with me pretty suddenly we had been a little off the past couple months but i wasnt expecting it at all ive probably been putting pressure on him because of coronavirus has brought me great anxiety and obsessive behaviour causing me to nag him about hand washing and obsessively cleaning stuff and getting frustrated about him going to the shops too often he said he just wants to be alone hes staying with his parents during quarantine and he wants to focus on that he said hes just not happy he said he still loves me and sees a future with me but he cant be with me and just needs a time to be alone and work on himself and his happiness he keeps saying i deserve better and he cant give me what i want and he cant give me all his love when he doesnt love himself he hasnt completely ruled out us getting back together but he doesnt want to tell me to wait for him and he just cant tell the future he said he wants to keep all of our memories and polaroids i couldnt it was too hard just in case he doesnt want to removeblock me on any social media because he said hes finding it hard to he said ill be the first person he contacts when he feels happier or better againi dont have anxietydepression so i just want to be able to understand and was wondering ifi just have a few questionscan someone please explain to me what he might be going through and why he wants to be alone and why hes just given up all of a suddenare there any signs that might show me he does still lovecare about me part of me is afraid it could just be an easy escapewhats the best approach to this situationhow can i stop myself from having hope that we might get back togetherhas anyone been in this situation before being the breaker upper or the breaker upee and how did it turn outim honestly so crushed about his decision of cutting me off but i want what is best for him if you have anything that can help me understand better i would really appreciate thank you,3.0

62139,does anyone else get depressed by advice i suppose i should preface this by saying that after moving back home and going to college locally i dont struggle with depression as much as i used to so it isnt a constant daily thing for me that being said hearing or reading advice about selfimprovement even very wellmeaning advice always throws me back into a depressed state i cant put my finger on why that is exactly but im usually affected the most when the advice says you should not feel bad about yourself and not sugarcoat that the responsibility is on you to do better so a lot of what you see on reddit im thinking that maybe this type of advice calls attention to how little faith i have in myself to improve myself in a meaningful way so i feel very hopeless about my chances of ever doing better can anyone relate to this and this cant be healthy right how do you all deal with it,3.0

62184,i just need a break recently i have hit an alltime low when trying to think about what got me to this point i cant help but think of my past it may jump around a bit but i have never really put this into wordswhen i was a child my mother and father divorced my mother won custody of myself and my sister i had an older brother that wasnt my fathers and two little brothers that were born when i was  i am not sure when it happened probably around when i was  but my mom got really heavy into drugs she would smoke crack meth weed and drink regularly all sorts of people came around and the money from child support was spent on drugs and not clothes school supplies or dental care my mom actually only ever took me to a dentist one time my whole  years i lived with her when i was  my mother let one of her many drug addict friends live with us at our house during one of her episodes of coming down where she was screaming at me and telling me how my father will never love me her druggie friend took me into the room he stayed in and comforted me at the time i didnt realize that a grown man should not be spooning naked with a little boy and touching him on the penis unfortunately he did not stop there but it happened and i cannot change it not too long after that he went to jail for some drug related warrant and then my mom had me live in the room he had yeah i had to sleep in the room i was molested in i never told my mom about it because she would never believe me i only told my dad when i was much oldera few years past and my mom moved from verbal abuse to physical abuse if i did the littlest thing to annoy her or upset her she would chase me into a corner scream at me about how worthless i was and hit me repeatedly my mom was not the only one however who decided that hurting me was enjoyable my older sister started to tell people lies to make it so i had no friends she would tell them that i was gay this is the early  so being gay was not a popular thing however plot twist i am not gay she was just lying so no one would talk to me she would tell them that if they wouldnt talk to me that she would hang out with them instead or just flat out tell them to never talk to me again regularly she would tell me how my father never loved me and how she was the favorite when we would visit my dad she would go out of her way to do everything in her power to upset me and cause me to act out verbally abusing me until i would yell at her and then pretend i started it hitting me or unplugging my playstation while i was gaming she would always tell on me if i stayed up late and did everything she could to get me in trouble i had no escape my dad tried to get custody of me and my sister and my sister and mother told me that he only wanted custody of me so that he wouldnt have to pay child support and that he doesnt really love me my mom would go into crying fits and tell me i was selfish and that i was abandoning her and the family so i told the guardian enlightem not sure how the spelling goes that i couldnt testify and that i had nothing to say she remained in custody of me and the abuse only got worse from therearound the time when i was  my mother was heavily dependent on drugs we ate pasta every night because it was the cheapest thing to buy and she began hitting me in front of company at this time i had a cell phone so i called my dad and he called the cops the cops showed up and told her that she should use a phone book because it doesnt leave marks and gets the point across i was the sole person taking care of my little brother with autism she never watched him and my step dad was a dead beat drunkdrug addict she was in one of her frenzies when she directed this anger at my little brother she went up to him because he was being loud at a show he would often yell at the tv and talk incoherently and raised her hand at him to hit him i got up off the couch and got inbetween them and told her to never lay a hand on him she punched me in the face and broke my nose but honestly worth itat this time my dad decided to try and get custody again my mother knew exactly what to do to make me stay she told my little brother with autism in front of me that i was going to leave him and never come back he cried so hard and it hurt so badly i of course chose to stay my sister however chose to leave she had just given birth and left to live with my dad smiling at me when she left she knew all along that it was a better life for me and never once tried to help me at this point i had no friends i was completely alone i spent all day playing video games and smoking weed to be as numb as i could to get by i got a job so i could put food on the table that was not noodles my mom would regularly get weed from me but i was doing it on purpose to control her outburts if i kept her high maybe she wouldnt abuse me anymore right only until i run out of weed that is i had friends that would hang out with me and smoke but we never talked about anything they would smoke and then leave i just wanted someone to care enough to stay at this point i was sleeping through all of my classes at school because my crack house home was partying all night and i never got any sleep i tried to ask my mom one time to quiet down so i could sleep for school and got beat for being ungratefulwhen i was  my sister moved back with my mom she told me that my dad was so mean to her and that he did not care about us at all at this point i knew that it was bullshit but i played along and pretended to hate my dad until i was visiting my dad and i broke down and told him as much as i could at that time i couldnt tell him everything just like how i wont say everything right now but i told him enough and begged him to let me stay i called my mom and had her sign over a temporary custody order that would let me stay with him until i was  i knew that if i ever went back id kill her or i would kill myselfmy dad tried to be supportive he tried to give me everything i needed and cared about me i was just so broken and used to being yelled at and abused that i got defensive about everything we would argue often and he began to hate me it got really bad when i dropped out and got my ged because i never excelled at school i started dating someone and i proposed to her shortly after she got pregnant my dad kicked me out i had to drop out of school and work at walmart in order to support my newly born son my fiancés family hated me they were christian and blamed me for her getting pregnant she began to hate me and started yelling at me all the time everything i did made her angry and she would regularly tell me how she wished that i was not the father so she would never have to see me again and how she thought he was better off without me i got really depressed and thought about ending my life she told me to do ithonestly i wanted to the only reason i did not was because of my son i wanted to do everything i could to make sure that he had the best life possible and i was going to try and make it work with her i put up with her abuse for a year before i broke up with her she began dating someone else a year later and told him that i was the one who treated her badly and how i forced her to have sex with me he began texting me threatening messages and threatening me saying how he would beat my ass and show my son what a real man is and how he calls me daddy because you will never be a father to him i did everything i could to be a father to my son and got so far in debt because i put everything i had into giving him what he needs rather than paying my bills it got so bad that my dad told me i could move back home and go back to college i gladly accepteda few months later my dad decides to move to out of state taking me with him i was working part time so i could still support my son and was so badly in debt i couldnt live on my own i had no choice right i dont know i really dont anymorewe moved and i got a new job and saved up all of my money to make sure i could see my son i had to buy  worth of plane tickets because he was under the age of  so i had to fly out and get him to see him and i gladly did this he is the only thing in my life that has ever made me feel so happy and when i am with him it makes me realize how happy i can really be i kept flying him out regularly and over time my son would tell me about what her family tells him about me how i am a bad person and not a good father but despite this he still loved me but every time i had to send him home to his mother a part of me died inside the feeling of emptiness would get bigger and happiness became a day dream i started dating a girl and it was all going good that is until she gave me an std and i found out she had been cheating on mei drifted through the next few years i got my cna and worked hard at my job barely getting by and spending my extra money to see my son i spent the next few years just trying to survive i sold my gaming consoles to pay my bills and i am not even writing this on my own computer the only thing i own is a phone and a bed months ago i attempted to commit suicide by overdose i was hurting so much and was so stressed out i just wanted the pain to stop i couldnt talk to my girlfriend because whenever i tried to she would get mad or upset and say things like i dont feel like im in love with you anymore or i dont know if i want to be with you honestly i didnt want to lose her so i kept it all to myself hoping i could keep her in my life and try to get better while i do all my friends are online friends and i really just wanted someone to be therethe night i tried to die i was feeling years of pain all at once i couldnt cope and i took the pills and wanted to sleep i didnt realize how much it would hurt i was itchy hot in pain and barely conscious i played there thinking about all the people i love and how i know what depression can do to a person i never wanted to put the pain i feel every day on someone i love so i called for help determined to get help and get betteri spent a day in the hospital before being shipped off to a mental health hospital i called my girlfriend on the way there and she dumped me it hurt badly but i understand why i spent  days in the hospital and was released nothing eventful happened just dealing with the physical issues from the overdose and stressing about moneyi leave the hospital and the day i leave i collected my items from where i lived with my girlfriend and talked with her she cried i consoled her and she said she still loves me but cant be with me i go to my dads and try to recover up until this point my dad never showed compassion for me having depression he thought i could just get over ita week later my ex calls me crying saying how she loves me and needs me so i drive an hour to see her we have sex and spend  days together her telling me how much she loves me and how she missed me so much then i find out that her friend tried to have sex with her while she was drunk and asleep the day after i got out of the hospital she woke up and said no and she says he stopped then i read the text messages he would bring up my suicide attempt to upset her and then ask her to come over or say she should sleep in his bed the guy was using me to try and have sex the woman i loved and wanted to marry she then told me she wants to stay friends with him and said we cant be together even though i never got upset with her and was understanding of what her friend did i was a wreck i barely remember the next week i just remember calling her crying because i was in so much pain and that i wanted the pain to stop then her getting mad at me and telling me how selfish i am the next day she asks me to come over and i do we end up in a casual relationship and she says we are going to be together again someday i promise i love you so much youre the best thing that ever happened to me we are going to get married someday i was genuinely happy and so hopeful for the first time in a month after i wanted to diebut good things dont last she got distant told me she thought i was getting the wrong idea and that she didnt want to lead me on she said that we cant be friends but that shes afraid if we arent together that i might kill myself ive never threatened her or anyone i have dated with suicide so this confused me and threw me for a loopi never felt like a bigger piece of trash i wasnt trying to hold her hostage in the relationship i felt so horrible it ate at me until i had a breakdown i called her and told her that i cant deal with the lies and false promises and tried to tell her how i felt but she got mad so i lied and said i was blocking her number then theres my job i got a job working in veterinary which is what i always wanted but i have so much debt that i am suffocating i didnt work for  months and only got paid for one because my old job required my doctor to allow me back to work which he only recently did i feel like the biggest problem in everyones life and i wanted to keep my promise that i would keep on living but its so hard all i can think about is making the pain stop but i cant get help because i cant afford it my son visited for the holidays and after he went home his mother called me my son was crying because one of his shirts smelled like me and he missed me that much i cannot be far from him anymore ,3.0

62277,my life isnt shit anymore but seems just as meaningless tldr go to last paragrapharound  months ago i had a realization that i had been using video games as a way to escape from the real world pretty much my entire life i was totally consumed by them every minute i was at school or work i would be thinking about the next rare item drop or the next strategy or build i would try out that evening my social life consisted of my brothers friends we would play video games or board games together quite often i eventually joined the army at  i had a history of depression at a young age and was honestly just going there to let myself get killed i am not going to get into it too much here but in the military there is always fear present you never know when you are going to wake up and there is a room inspection or you get told you are going to the field for the weekend or some other bullshit on the bright side i became good at my job and felt some comradery with other people but i was still spending all of my free time gaming i missed out on so much in life and looking back now i can see how much ive wastedmy military contract ran out and i decided not to reenlist this was because i thought i would have a better life on the outside surely nothing could be much worse than i had already been through i was right and it makes life terribly numbi am  now ive been out of the army for a little over  years i am going to college which i never thought i would do i only need to make around  per year to meet my living expenses after the gi bill payments so i dont really work much or need to workin june of last year my computer graphics card broke i spent a month of experiencing the real world and it was actually okay when i finally got a new graphics card video games felt so pointless i was trying to figure out what to do with myself so i started working from home i made a good amount of money in the last  months of the yeartwo weeks ago i moved to a nice apartment for those  months i was sleeping on the floor because i got rid of my bed for a workspace i was spending all of my time either working or doing college schoolwork i now have a new bed couch tv everything i could want i was just walking around my new place and it is perfect and i hate it i wish there was something i could be struggling for something to drive me towards the next point in my life previously my motivation was to make some money so i could move to a new place where ive lived from getting out of the military up until this month was absolute garbage the realization that i needed to move was when a cop was shot and killed across the street not long ago so now i am at a point in my life where i dont know what to do school is going well simply because im bored and just do school stuff video games are terrible there is one person i hang out with every month or two i have no social life because i feel no connection with other people i have all of the material things i want i guess the point of writing this is to ask for advice on what to do i feel like life has no meaning anymore and the only time i felt that it did have some meaning is when i was struggling the most i hear people talk about living a happy and fulfilling life but that doesnt appeal to me i want a struggle i want something that is unfulfilled in my life that i can work towards and i dont know where to find it,3.0

62302,my version of depression wanting to share   i dug a hole and put myself in it it wasnt a deep hole but every halfattempt to escape clearly failed i found myself learning helplessness and accepting i was stuck there i told myself that time would help that tomorrow would be better next month and next year i placated myself with distractions electronics luxuries endlessly covering my eyes so i could not see the hole that was my trap others see my hole from above the look inside my trap and they cant understand why i want to be there it isnt that deep their perception is skewed their holes dont exist it isnt their fault i dug my hole and placed myself in it it isnt their job to help me out and sometimes the best intentions by others deepen the hole platitudes are often their tools of support it isnt that bad look at the good things it is hard to see those good things when you are surrounded by walls and deep in holes just do some exercise itll fix you up i have no strength and barely have the drive to go to work anything left is trying to look normal at work to not shrivel and stay in bed taking a shower brushing my teeth getting into the car sitting at a desk takes an immense amount of effort and often time feels insurmountable i dont want to die quite the opposite but i despise feeling helpless unwanted worthless regardless whether or not these feelings are true or justified we have loved ones that want to help us that want us in their lives but we are in our hole we dont see that we see darkness bullying us and training us to lose hopethen the worst happens we change the right comment sparks something or a new job shows us a spark of opportunity we struggle because for a moment we see a reason to try again this is the most precarious moment people see us changing and growing crawling out of the hole slowly but relentlessly  they dont know they see our hands outside the hole hooray they are cured normal cured people can handle stresses responsibilities requirements and needs we are learning slowly and then everything is expected of us dumped on us as if we are an eagle soaring in the sky and not a chick that fell from a nest struggling to get back to a place of normalityit doesnt matter to most i know my wife sister and family mean the best it makes me want to give up again and just stop trying,3.0

62333,dealing with a depressed dad hi guys this is probably a rant but i dont know what else to do i am  and my dad  is depressed and emotionally unstableimmature a couple years ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusivepossibly sexually abusive prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way i am a girl but he named me after his father and gave me a male name as my middle name this childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible i am  years old and i have never depended on my dad he is terrible with money and always in between jobs he also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship my dad is a very traditional indianhindu he does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga i do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor this isnt a bad thing i know but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and steals things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress it has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my  siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to find purpose but i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside when my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus i am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults i am not a religious person and i dont think any religion is beyond reproach i think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money his siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel fulfilled then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none as an aside after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study aerospace engineering i was unable to go because my dad said he had no money a couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education as a donation so he could feel good about himself i have never forgiven him for this he goes out of his way to provide for others and does nothing for my siblings mom and i no one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years now that  is happening were supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick my dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for  my older sister is a  doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital she has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad he refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations he has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to canada to start a new life soon this has been my breaking point so today i finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent it was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasnt my intention but i just lost it today after years of dealing with his behavior i have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my fathers behavior has been more stressful to deal with i dont know what to do now so maybe someone can help me it is not my intention to cause pain to anyone but how do you balance this must i always let him take advantage of me because he is depressed i feel like his depression has ruined my life in many ways but i dont want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than try to address it directly with him seeing as he is not emotionally mature enough to handle criticism someone please help me,3.0

62689,you just need to get out and socialise make friends apparently that is the cure for depression i want to know how that is the cure when it is also part of the cause like i became depressed because i stopped socialising no i stopped socialising because i became depressed i had to cut off my family again because after i told my grandmother who raised me after my mother died that my father verbally abused me just because we had a political disagreement and that he even went as far as to call me names she started laughing at me i already feel like my father is a tyrant and a bully whos never been a father to me but now i have to deal with the knowledge that my grandmother who means more to me than anyone might not be much different it wrecked me i was visiting her at the time and had to just get up and leave i havent seen her or anyone else in my family since its been over a year now it might seem like such a small thing but her laughing face haunts me i lost my mum when i was  my mothers mother went back to nz soon after she died lost my dad because he became the worst monster imaginable and now i have to deal with the fact that my grandmother fathers mother was never on my side either sometimes i cant believe that im related to any of them like i was accidentally born into the wrong family or that im cursed,3.0

62707,fuck it hey guys im really struggling i grew up in a super conservative religious environment forced into it by my parents as an only child and with emotionally abusive parents who were only together because divorce isnt allowed in the church side note apparently a child would help save the marriage and also my grandma wanted a grandchild i was isolated from the world outside the church told not to make close friends at school rarely taken to visit family because they werent in the church not allowed to date etc i ended up getting married at  in an attempt to find a semblance of happiness and finally got up the courage after many therapy sessions to get divorced and leave the church and my parents altogether at  since then ive become financially independent got a phd at  started a career all the stuff thats good on paper but id trade it all for close friends and family for people to lean on i have this terrible neckshoulderhead pain which is supposedly from anxiety and the way i think of it is that i can only lean on myself so of course my muscles are ridiculously tense i didnt ask to be born into that fucking terrible environment i didnt ask for this fucking life at this point i wouldve rather not been born and often wake up disappointed i didnt die in my sleep i know many of you feel the same because a life lived so alone is definitely not a life worth living its all just too much for me when can i lay down my burdens and just lean on someone else for a change god damn it i mean i have friends i have crushes i have coworkers etc but its not enough im constantly brainstorming for something anything i do have a psychiatrist and he says im doing all the right things and we get along quite well compared to the many therapists ive tried in the past that can fix this pain and frustration so now im in fuck it mode im reaching out to anyone who ever seemed like they cared no longer worried about being embarrassed or disappointed because fuck it i need help so from one depressed person to another help me please reddit ,3.0

62738,depression is worse under quarentine im sitting here typing to you guys today wondering if im even worth anything i know its a ridiculous statement but with this virus thing going on i cant even run from the depression anymore via working or playing games im burnt out doing all the same stuff at home and having to deal with the immense quiet only broken by the intrusive suicidal thoughtsi would never act on them but it is agonizing being so damn sad for no reason and with no relief other than food at this point but i also have to ration that since im out of work and cant afford my bills now if my projections are correct once this is over i will have lost internet my car and quite potentially the place in which i stayive been given all of the extensions and yet afterwards this catch up game is going to be dreadful i was so close to being able to afford medication or a regular psych visit people have no idea what its like to not be able to have relief for years because i cant afford itive tried having friends but in the end im just too much of a downer or if anything the guy people go to with their problems to make themselves feel better i cant run from my mind now and to be honest it really isnt even saying anything other than panic and die the immense feeling of dread and hopelessness is only magnified by this quarantinei find no joy in anything anymore i dont eat because food tastes like grey i dont go outside because i cant and honestly wont even if i could i wish i had people who believed in me and pushed me to be a better person but anyone i know just shoves into my face that i should just be able to shake it offive been trained my whole life to view myself as worthless by my abusive household and no matter how hard i try to be better learning new skills being positive going outside for walks working out it all just somehow makes me feel worse i hate myself so much and i hate being alive not having the courage to end it wow what a b i turned out to beupdate it appears im lucid for a moment but writing this post made me lose it i got a few cuts and bruises from the self harm but nothing permanent but i feel like im gasping for breath with only one nostril above the waters surface i will lose myself again,3.0

62843,my family just makes things worse so i deal with depression and anxiety that itself is hard for my family i recently have been trying to communicate with them which i never really did before and it feels so much better to say what your feeling or just talking to someone because thats a way to get your mind off something its all gone downhill now my anxiety has worsened and im having anxiety attacks everyday and its annoying my parents when its the third day in a row where im asking them to sit with me my mom will get frustrated in the heat of the moment and start cussing out at me telling me to just stop acting this way wanting me to act normal and saying how the only reason im having anxiety is because i didnt take the medication if i am having an anxiety attack i refuse to take most medications in fear that they will make me sick or worsen my anxiety my dad has only recently started helping me but i tire everyone out with my anxiety so he is kind of getting annoyed at the fact i am freaking out at  am and to top it all of with the parent stuff they fight nonstop and its hurtful i will hear them cussing out throwing things and all that i have little siblings so i cant imagine what they think my mom is always crying because my dad doesnt love her but she only stays for us my family is emotionally divorced at this point and it would almost be better if they separated but at the same time it wouldnt help at all with my mental situation and my siblings,3.0

62880,i wat to be ended female  a bit of a rant just because i need to analyse some things sorry for the english it isn´t my first language as time goes by living with depression gets to a place of nothingness i finally understand depression enough to see it in others who don´t know what it is yet but why sould it matter to me i call it the boogeyman so mby people understand it better whenever i am asked how i am i don´t know i´m totally empty and i don´t understand anything i don´t want to do anything but i don´t want to do nothing my mind is sprinting with thoughts but i forget them really quickly i don´t remember anything and i have massive amounts of anxciety i don´t want to live but i wasn´t made to end myself i find that it is very easy for me to take part of rebellious or selfharming activites i am constantly reminded of the person i used to be turns out i have dealed with depression for a very long period and i am just now realizing it i don´t sleep but i sleep all the time but also no i now understand why the hang in there positiviti quouts don´t work on me i understood that something was wrong when one of my frends told me you do know that it´s not okay to feel shit all the time just as simple as that no one had ever notized that bc i always had left the impression of a really outgoing funny gal and i remember her too i moved and i go walking every night i got a cat who is just a princess i keep my primary need fed i am handling depression with a clear sight and i understand the difference between me and the boogeyman i do so much for me just so i can feel better for a momentall the work i have done still feel like shit and i don´t understand how time works imagine you are in your own body but didn´t know how to walk yet you are doing it every day you are walking but it feels wrong it feels like you are still learning to walk in an adult body food doesn´t have taste to it i am doing a great job i take my meds walk exescise eat draw whatever i still feel like nothing is helping i know it takes time but am i up to wait that long everything feels pointless the world is overcrowded anyway and the only thing i´ll leave behind is a memory of me in the minds of others we all gon die anywayeverything and nothing is happening at the same time i understand that i have a medical condition that prevents me to see what i can be in this world i am so tired i am tired of nothing and everything i dont know what i want or need and whatever lil peep was raping about i sorta understand it i want to die but i wasn´t made to die trough me  i started to test selfharm to understand to feel pain in a different way but then the realization came to me that mind and body work together a depressed persons body is constantly aching mind and body pain but who knows mby this state of not understanding nothing or understanding to take care of selfs´ primal needs is a step forward but i feel it is gotten to a point i can´t understand if i´m getting better or i feel like this shit is getting old i have smoked some weed to feel better and it helps but costs more than the antidepressants but weed helps me to think about more household worries and i let my dr know everything i want to die but i am not made to end myself,3.0

63128,girlfriend left me likely due to depressionrelated issues wondering how to support a few weeks ago my girlfriend very suddenly broke up with me saying she had a lot to deal with on her own and couldnt be in a relationship she didnt go into further detail but i know shed be getting into a negative headspace for a while had started some new drugs etc so i assume its related to that needless to say im heartbroken i dont blame her just the situation but im still in love with her weve talked a bit since then but ive been trying to give her space so she doesnt feel pressured at all since i know when youre feeling depressed even talking can seem like a big demand seeing as were not together anymore is there a best way i could still support her and help her through this if we did end up getting back together after this period im not entirely hopeful about it but hey cant hurt to hope a bit how could i help her and support her in the future if things started getting bad again,3.0

63227,so i was on ask reddit and they asked about any i cannot believe this is happening moments i commented this and i think yall could benefit more from it hope yall get through the day ❤️ it was  am in may  and my mother had been suffering from insomnia for a while she hadnt been herself for the few weeks following up to this but we put it down to lack of sleep and nothing more my parents were sleeping in different rooms even though they love eachother very much just so she could sleep better we were supposed to go to a charity hike at dawn to watch the sunrise with my neighbors in support of a suicide helpline we all sleep in because were not morning people my dad gets up at  and checks on my mum but shes not in bed he goes down to my sister to ask if shes heard her or seen her but she was asleep too he spends the next  minutes looking for her around the house until he checks the garage and finds her hanging from the wooden supports on the roof i was suicidal when i was  and my parents found out they asked me what i had done and i lied to them and told them i tried it from the banister in the garage even though that wasnt what i was doing i made something up on the spot my dad calls the police etc and wakes me up at  and tells me whats happened my mother was and still remains the person im closest to i dont have close friends and nobody else in the house is like me the way she was i still remember that morning through the tears in my eyes trying to force on my socks and struggling and then the authorities running through the house that day all the doors were open and the house became cold not because of the breeze but the life had been drained from it i went mute for the following months after that and the next few months were a blur i dont remember them at all i was  when it happened im  now well be passing her  year anniversary soon and it still doesnt feel right only decided to say this because everyone else was opening up i see a lot of im not committing suicide because itll make my mum sad memes floating around and yeah theyre all well and good but everyone needs to know the pain you feel from losing someone you love is so much worse than anything you can imagine anyone can become suicidal my mam was  and i thought she was the strongest person alive she had made such an impact on so many people in her life the line to get into her wake was  km long and an ambulance was on standby because it was considered such a big event she had so many people that loved her and during the time it took her to kill herself she just couldnt see them not me not my sisters or my dad she couldnt see anyone everyone needs to know theyre loved by so many people even if they cant see it and they need to know that they need to reach out go to therapy try anything ,3.0

63291,keep fighting some days i have depression some days it has me  today is one of the latter but i am no easy captive  i do not surrender  when the exhaustion comes creeping up my spine like goosebumps and i start to sink into the cold embrace some worldhardened survival instinct awakens and says not today ginger damnit and i get up and fight the best way i know how by creating order in my home combatting the disorder in my mind  every cardboard box recycled every towel folded every pan scrubbed is a rebellion on my part a raging determination that helps me live to fight another day  if you are gripped by the same deadened fingers dont ever stop resisting their lure,3.0
63292,in my head trigger warning it all started feb   my grandpa hung himself in the basement of his two story house i didnt understand not many people had nice things to say about him he was an alcoholic and substance abuser he was occasionally called a loser but when he was around me i didnt see any of that i was his first grandbaby out of  kids when i would visit my father on weekends parents were spilt he would be there we would take walks to the store to get candy a cheap movie to watch because my dad couldnt afford cable and make breakfast for dinner his pancakes were so awesome he had the loudest and greatest laugh ever it was hard to not laugh with him even if the joke wasnt even funnybefore he moved in with my dad he lived in an apartment building and i stayed the night i feel asleep on the couch playing my ds and had my head on pillow that was in his lap and i remember his panicking because he thought i stopped breathing while i was sleeping all i remember was waking up and he was making sure i wouldnt stop breathing he would call to make sure everything was okaybut then he died ive never felt pain like that before not even stubbing a broken toe off of the wall would hurt that as bad as that did i was only in  grade and ended up having barely any friends because no one wanted to be around a kid who was sad all the time nobody wanted to be friends with the kid who refused to talk to anyone i would go home and cry myself to sleep and wonder if i couldve done anything to help my father now drinks  of the time and my grandpa is all he thinks about when he does my father had mentioned how he wanted to die sometimesi still feel it  years later as if it just happened yesterday my dog was like an emotional support dog for me but shes gone now too i no longer enjoy writing reading painting going on walks etc i barely eat because i work and go to college  of the time when i do sometimes i make myself throw up because of distress life is honestly so stressful and i dont know what to do anymore,3.0

63310,i think my depression is manifesting in weird ways for the past couple weeks ive been feelingoff i cant describe what it feels like maybe numb apathy i havent really been happy nor sad just kind of going with the flow but ive been having a sneaking suspicion that my partner has been being unfaithful i dont really have any reason to think this shes never been unfaithful before but i think the feelings are coming from my inability to feel loved i constantly feel like im not good enough and dont know if i can live up to her expectations i tried texting her about it saying i felt like shes been cheating and i think its depression manifesting in a weird way she was upset that i could even think that she was cheating and got frustrated and stopped texting me back i tried explaining that i dont think im thinking clearly because ive been depressed but i honestly didnt realize that depression had hit me until i texted her about it when the only person i felt comfortable enough to talk about this to stopped responding to me it really hit me i started having suicidal thoughts again and started wishing i would get hit by a car on my bike ride home from work i think i just lost my self worth somewhere in the past month or so and im struggling to find it again she thinks im lazy and not driven enough to do anything with my life which reduced my feeling of self worth even more i dont know why i should continue to live if my life is so obviously pointless i feel like im hindering everyone in my life and theyd all be better off without me,3.0

63420,new here just some thoughts ive been trying to process i feel like ive just been existing not progressing my life not establishing goals not experiencing life not finding purpose not finding hobbies just existingi feel as if i really have to question why im still alive im not doing anything about my life i have no motivation to improve my situation or plan for the future it feels as if im alive simply because i havent died yet im not around for any particular purpose other than i happened to be born i am inherently meaningless the only argument against that that would even have the slightest bit of traction would be the relationships ive built but its inconsequential people can overcome grief ive done it when my mom killed herself it hurts for a while but you get over itand i guess that whats kept me alive so long the temporary grief i could cause to the people that have somehow come to like me as a person is that even a reason to live to live for others when you have no desire to continue yourself should you be obligated to keep going with a life you dont want because you may cause grief to other people who dont have to experience the pain you have to experience just to exist could such a person even defend their position knowing they hold it just to appease themselves can those people even be considered good people at that pointof the afflicted how can one deal with the obligations of life when existing is a decidedly nonconsensual act no person alive has a say in their existence and the experience of life is unjustly thrust upon every human alive how can someone of good conscience knowingly endorse an existence that was nonconsensual from its first moments how can you justify an act when the only person it affects the most has no say in the decision ,3.0
63421,spoke to my parents for the first time about cutting myself videopodcast i made this to see if it would help i made it for me and thats why its taken so long for me to share it publicly the few that have seen this video told me they were better for it and thats why im choosing now to release it initially the plan was to make many videos of this style and nature but the insecurities got the better of me depressions an easy topic to misinterpret and i didnt want to give people too much of myself only to have that be mocked or misunderstood but the longer i think about it the more i realize cutter v cutter isnt for those people as i said in the beginning its for me and i should express it for that same reason cutter v cutter is for anyone who might feel similarly to how i do and if you are one of those people i hope this video makes you feel a little less alone its currently unlisted and the only way to find this video is via this post i dont care for likes or views but if you know someone that this might actually help please send it their way tldr i talked to my parents about my struggles with depression and selfharm i filmed and edited it into a small documentary that you can view here please feel free to express any thought or feeling this may have provoked thats why im sharing it hoping to feel a little less alone myself sam,3.0

63425,am i depressed ive been trying to know if im depressed everyone around me keeps saying that i am and i need mental health help i know no one can diagnose me on this since youre all not trained professionals or psychiatrists but i want to know if there are similarities in the feelings and emotions or lack of that some of you can understand in your own lives ive always been kind of numb and had erratic moments in front of people i dont know if feeling like theres nothing to life than just living and existing and following each day is normal or me being hyper aware i dont have any goals at all and if i once said i want this or that i would later just accept death is easier im scared ill become numb enough to cut myself and so forth not like i havent harmed myself because i am a numb person you could say i have trich hair pulling disease as a result of being numb or needing to feel something right now in life i see nothing to live for i dont want to go to a doctor because i dont want help but i cant live in denial and i dont wanna be attention seeking so i want to know in privacy if its possible whatever im feeling right now is depression thank you,3.0

63432,i dont have social media because i have no friends am socially anxious and dont want people to see what a loser i am i dont have social media for the reasons listed in my title i was reading a post on reddit and apparently a lot of people dont trust those without any social media as though theyre off its just another crusty kick to my selfesteem on the selfhate pile ive been bullied all my life and even now i have no friends and other women see me as weird as ive been told they act more and more uncomfortable around me until they avoid me whats worse is that people dont expect a weird girl i always liked boyish things like video games sciences and not in a boasting way but literally since i was a little girl nowadays its perfectly fine for a girl to like gaming but when i was a kid it was weird and i was bullied for it so i stopped talking about myself and withdrew inwards so no one would bully me about my interests anymore i mightve been more open to bullying because my sisters would bully me and my parents either didnt care or would punish all of us so i became their personal toyevery encounter in which i expect to regularly be around someone is just a waiting game for them to start avoiding me people love to use me as a selfesteem boosting speaking down about me or putting down or disbelieving everything i say every time i tell people about this they say im  wrong and imagining things ironicallyalthough ive never been able to find a friend since i was a teenager im now in my  and in university guys strangely didnt care and i would still find guys who liked me although they were never sociallyadept guys as though the sociallyadept ones were worried id bring down their social status i had always believed in being single all my life although i said it was because i didnt believe in dating its because i had a low sexdrive because of depression and because i knew i probably would never find a good guy older ladies bullied me about needing to be modest and older men completed me on my modesty to my dad so i always wore large baggy clothing to hide myself i wasnt overweight and people liked to complement me on my attractiveness so i didnt hide myself because i thought i was ugly but because i felt like i wasnt worth showing myself like i was a slave who was there to make society happy and its what society wanted from mei was feeling better one week in my  and decided to date out of nowhere and rather quickly a guy asked me out and we ended up staying together and eventually got married it was very random i hate to say it but it vastly improved my life in a lot of ways although i got more lazy about social interaction since more social needs were met by him it does bring my selfesteem down to some extent because i feel embarrassed of myself in front of him he once couldnt handle how weird i acted in public and went off saying how he cant stand to be around me in public and how im hopeless around others he apologized later and said he was grumpy but i know hes right him going off only made me act even more insecure and anxious and weird in publici cant stand being around anyone i become so tense that i become pale and sick and get a headache stomachache and bunch of weird symptoms such as exhaustion if im in public too long such as around  hours not to mention acting very weird apparentlyim studying to be an engineer but i know ill need to start having social media if i want to look good to employers i might already be screwed since my social media accounts will be obviously new im surrounded by the feeling that i need to kill myself because im a burden to society and that no one wants me alive and mostly because im unable to take care of myself i wasnt raised properly and probably have a ton of problems my husband has assured me he wants me alive but he must think im someone im not im just a scary weird girl something needs to change about me quickly or im going to die someday alone and hating myselfi was abused and neglected as a child went through sexual emotional and physical abuse and sometimes my parents didnt care if we ate and i went hungry for days i remember how i only thought about food those times and would do anything for food my parents were drunks off and on drug addicts and would fight constantly then loudly have sex all the time they ignored their children but mostly me i was the one singled out to ignore and use for chores and yelling at although all us siblings experienced different forms of abuse my outlying family loved my sisters but ignored me similarly mostly because we had different dads and they didnt like my dad we moved constantly and were incredibly poor often homeless and had to stay with people or out of a tent my dad was illegally in the country and was in constant fear of being deported my mom left with my sisters without saying goodbye when i was  barely saw them again after that they didnt care about me left me alone with my abusive dad my dad died of cancer at  it was hellbecause of this upbringing im convinced i cant live in the real world and will always be incapable of living a normal life i went to therapy for a school semester and told them about my upbringing suicidal thoughts and also how i was struggling in my classes because i couldnt concentrate on any of my work they said what i was feeling was normal and a lot of people felt like me that nothings wrong with me and that i should take up yoga hearing this was a slap to the face and i believed this was lifes way of saying i didnt deserve help i went home and tried to kill myself but my husband made me feel better and said i was with the wrong therapist a large part of me felt he was wrong but a small part of me wanted to hang on to that hope i stopped going to therapy and started doing better with support from my husband but it was taxing on him and i hated needing him for help on this when i should be adult enough to handle it myselffor now im still struggling in school people mostly assume its because engineering is too hard for me and to take up something like art but i have a feeling its because im a woman people still dont like me and i dont know why or what is wrong with me or what im doing wrongi feel like my suicide is just waiting to happen constantly there telling me i need to give up and life isnt for me and that i make life harder for everyone else i dont benefit anyone elses life and i have no desire to live for myself because i hate myselfhow could i possibly have a social media i make crappy knit stuff sometimes but my interest in life is so low that i spend all my free time online trying to kill the emptiness and pain in my heartcan anyone relateoh yeah i should mention that my life now is infinitely better than when i was a kid i greatly appreciate having a loving husband being in a university an average state one and being safe i just have trouble operating like a normal person have depression and tend to be suicidal pretty often i dont feel capable of living a normal life with how messed up my mind is from my previous life it feels hopeless sometimes and i act very weird and dont think i could change that i feel like a huge burden to everyone in the world like i said before i didnt tell my husband about my suicidal thoughts and depression until a couple of years into the relationship and i generally dont tell him anything unless he pushes his questioning because he can always somehow tell when im not feeling well i try my best not to overwhelm him but he can tell when im sad and its often no matter how hard i try to act happy and it brings him down too i dont like hurting him like that,3.0

63438,my family doesnt know im suicidal im only  and i live with my family i used to love living at home but now i almost cant stand itevery pain i feel emotional or physical is invalid in my familys eyes they always think im faking it or trying to get out of something every time i bring up my troubles they say well what about mine my younger sister is suicidal and has threatened doing it before so weve been to the emergency suicide prevention places and everything since my sister is known to be suicidal whenever she has emotional issues its always treated seriously my mom has told me to my face that her problems are taken more seriously because shes at risk of suicide ive never been suicidal in the past but these days it really does feel like the nothingness of death would be a welcome release from this constant frustration i feel ive never made a solid plan and im probably too scared to actually go through with it but the thought still comes up often these days some days i wonder what itd feel like to press a gun to my head and oddly enough it gives me this strange sense of comfort itd just be over its not like this life matters anyway in the grand scheme of things maybe the universe will be reborn again billions and billions of years from now and maybe ill somehow come back again as another form of life or maybe not its doesnt really matterive always had big plans and ive always thought i was going to be someone someday but im just a horribly lazy person and even when i do work towards my goals weeks months and years will pass and nothings changed im in immediate debt to my school not to mention the loans im going to have to pay soon for a degree im not gettingi dont have a real job – i have a gig that pays well for now but its not enough to save up or last for long i want to leave this plays but my debt and financial situation prevent me from doing that dont go to college if you want some sense of freedom in your life somedaynobody in this world loves me that isnt obligated to my family and in a way it seems like offing myself is the only thing that would get them to actually care about my feelings i am crying for help and i do just want someone to pay attention to me but all of these things ive written are  how i feel and no one would listen to me if i didnt do something drastic no one cares about you until its too late and youre gone,3.0

63482,depression misdiagnosis i believe i actually have adhdpi important in this post i only want to share my experience and i am strictly not asking for any diagnosis  what i am asking is if anyone has had a similar experienceso here goesup until puberty i was a good student i had high grades roughly top of my class you could say in most subjects  classes i did not have to study very much to achieve this tests i would study the day before other homework i and my friends would try and finish as fast as possible after it was assigned yes we were hardcore nerds  puberty was a bad time i will be the first to admit it lots of changes mostly negative ones   since then i have also struggled academically very severely at times failed a year felt very very incompetent because of this i was also severely socially anxious around age    around  i went to college  university i initially liked it but i couldnt keep up with the heavy course load this was engineering  years went by in which i tried to motivate myself by putting intense pressure on myself psychologically which did not work my procrastination went to absolutely absurd levels i am pretty sure i am worse than anyone else on this planet this of course was followed by extremely intense self hatred really cannot be understated and all the rest for the longest time i believed i perfectly fit the picture of a person with anxiety and depression however it is only after learning about add  adhd in adults around age  that i really feel i fit that picture i am someone with fairly high iq so early in life it was never a problem i used to rush homework also together with my friends as quickly as possible to get it out the way as fast as we could this was a sport pretty much primary  elementary school was never an issue because we did not have homework lol after learning about adult adhd my depression and particularly self hate  self shame guilt etc reduced vastly i finally found something that made sense however they could not diagnose me as i did not show enough symptoms in childhood i show clinically enough symptoms now it is severely negatively impacting my life i had to stop with my engineering degree  years ago because i could not do it logical if you really had add right because the course load completely overwhelmed me i had tried all behavorial techniques nothing workedi have enough energy to go to the gym do other fun stuff even today thinking about my past  my life and what could have been gets me extremely depressed isnt that logical but you see i am not intrinisically depressed i find enjoyment in things that do not remind me of my past or things i struggle with if that makes sense i do not have any of the physical symptoms of depression currently not to sound like some self pitying fool but nobody at the moment really wants to believe me as i did not get the diagnosis it is ironic because i used to think the same way as the doctors my parents all people now who say i do not have it before i really properly understood what add was am i fooling myself or what is going on here i am extremely reluctant to take an ssri which i have been given as i do not believe it will help me in the past it would have made more sense particularly for anxiety but i do not believe i suffer from anxiety or depression anymore at the root,3.0

63581,my personal advice to a dear friend i hope he listens depression in my experience is like a pit youre standing on the edge and every so often someone  or something comes along and knocks you into the pit then youre down there its dark and cold and lonely and you cant see a way out you try scrambling up the walls but you keep slipping back down you get tired and its harder and harder to see a way out then you start thinking about all the other things in your life that make you unhappy and you end up giving up if you could just turn around and look behind you youd see that there is a rope hanging down with someone who wants to help you at the other end ive been holding the rope but you either cant see it or im not strong enough to pull you out on my own but there are other people with ropes who are strong enough and they want to help you out you just have to grab onto the rope so i guess thats your decision grab onto the rope or stay in the pit and watch me walk away because i cant do any more my go to saying right now is you cant set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm thats where i am at i want to be there for you but i cant be your friend it hurts too much to watch you ignoring the ropes  ,3.0

64222,i am concerned for my girlfriend my girlfriend and i have only been together for about  months but i really really enjoy seeing her and doing things with her she makes me really happy well most of the timeher outlook on life is what one would call flawed she has never been diagnosed with depression but just being around her you can tell shes mega down in the dumps almost all of the time shes incredibly unmotivated to do anything she doesnt want to and she barely has any willpower of her own she spends most nights playing videogames drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee and going to sleep anywhere from  am of course with quarantine shes been sleeping in till around noon but before quarantine she would sleep her day away in school she doesnt think school is important because she doesnt think shes important she has dreams to live in a nice apartment in the city or a cozy cottage in the country but she has given up ever achieving them because shes not willing to put any effort into it now this would be a lot more solvable if not for the fact that she is very conscious of why this is a problem she knows that she needs to put effort into fixing her outlook on life and that is the exact reason why she doesnt want to try any scrap of improvement to her health or lifestyle has either been forced on her by her parents who do absolutely nothing to prevent her bad habits or suggested by me and she never takes my advice she gets defensive when i try to persuade her to do some of her work and it usually ends up in some form of small argument i would like to mention that i do not end this relationship right here right now because i know that if she gets the support she needs this wont happen i stick around because im hopeful that she will change her perception on work and effort and in turn she will learn to be more appreciative of herself and the people around herthen theres the third and most pressing issue on the matter she believes that she doesnt care about anyone she has told me before that shes a  narcissist who only cares about herself of course she has mostly demonstrated the exact opposite in her actions yes sometimes it feels like shes trying to ignore me when shes in a bad mood and yes she rants about her friends a lot but other than that her actions completely devalue her words she enjoys doing things with me she feels bad when my feelings are hurt and she shows kindness even if its a small gesture on a daily basis she cares about how i and others feel again unless shes in a bad mood and although it certainly seems like she cares quite a lot less than a normal person i know for a fact that she still caresthe matter of therapy is a prevalent issue with her ive only suggested it once and she got very upset when i did im not sure why she is so disgusted by the idea of therapy but the way she reacted made me afraid to suggest it again and thats an issue i definitely believe she needs therapy because this is far beyond anything i or any of her friends can manage my only problem is that i dont know how to get her to try it i dont want to make her feel forced because thats never a good thing i dont want to not bring it up because then she wont improve but i also know that if i do shell just disregard anything i say after that because she generally doesnt really seem to want helpmy question for you all is this how do i persuade my girlfriend to get therapy without jeopardizing our relationship caps so people can see it betteri know you all may have concerns such as why is this guy still in a relationship with this girl and why should you even try to keep the relationship together at this point and to that i say this she makes me incredibly happy whether shes in a real tough spot or if shes feeling elated she always makes me smile for different reasons of course yes some things she does may come across as kind of mean and a little inconsiderate but shes only ever like that when shes feeling down i know therapy wont just magically fix her forever and ever therapy doesnt work that way but to be able to see her happy even if its just slightly more often than she is now would make me super happy sometimes i get a little bit too caught up in her problems but never so much that i forget to take care of myself ive been through this stuff before if i thought that my being with her was an overall detriment to my life i would end it right here right now i would like to add that i am not in this relationship to be her personal therapist she has never tried to manipulate me and she is an absolute blast to hang out with i am with her because i love her not because i love the idea of being in a relationship i am doing this because i love her and i want to see her happy i never expected to be this deep into it whenever i first told her i liked her and initiated this whole affair but now that i am all i want is the best for her while still playing the part of a boyfriend i dont want to father her because thats weird if any of you could give me advice on how to get her to not hate the idea of therapy please please tell me this is very important to me,3.0

64266,a new year a new me long i have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last new years but i didnt the reason is i had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning while still being at my worst at this point i made changes to improve myself i lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times i took weed edibles etc i did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss i know i didnt push myself to my full potential i messed days up and i mean thats fine but i got off track and into a depressive state after those days every new years i reevaluate my life to be or not to be and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether i want to approach the next year at all this year im cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where i push myself harder than i ever have to see if i can do it and whether theres something out there worth it for me i am going to give myself the best fighting chance i can its easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it and dont get me wrong its hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head buti personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad if we dont fight whats the fucking point righti read a post i think on here where they named their depression frank i mean its also known as monkey brain this has helped me quite a bit over the past year but yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank say hi frank you can piss off now or swiper no swiping lol dora depressed lol but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank from there i like to torture frank franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night the way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domainyou flex your arm right now it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control remember that if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will  you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing rejuvenated and alive if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart shits a god damn drug to meit hypes me the fuck up torture methods also include exercise have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chestneck hell no i am personally going to challenge many things i have already been doing and some i have been slacking on and new challengesmy list includes  am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of  am no masturbation for the whole year its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit you will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year cold showersexercisetrain hard with a program up to you and only  days off for recovery at max get light body weightcardio on these days half hourof meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed  day bulking fasting routinesnake dietside note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts ive lost over  on it just do it it will make your life so much easier and better it changes your mindset if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline whats stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort which leads me to this post and my new years resolutionbeyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion dry yearlearn guitar and master  songs at leastsinging too improve the workload i can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so im not stressing outnaturally these habits will replace filler activitiesbad habitsdepressive habits like gamingnetflixgetting highstaying in bed from  to bedtime stuck in your head for hours on end i have pretty much cut all of these out i need to work on youtube a little still i have already cut down my subscriptions to people i actually watch and enjoy and that might only be  to  videos a day i watch maybe one for you is social media addiction i dont use social get off that shit that ding notification dopamine hit you get oh who texted me etc what did this person post why am i not getting likes on this post etc also if you post god damn everything you do online there is nothing to talk about with another person for example ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them i know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that but this is where i call home for the past few years i just wanted to share my guidelines i will follow for the year to decide it all i know i am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way im tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if i just outthink frank that everything will be better you cant outthink feelings its time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better if anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death im tired of feeling and living this way and im sure im not the only one,3.0

64508,i used to want to die everyday and now that i might be i regret ever saying those things im an  year old male i have a brain tumour that affects my hormones and with that my body is going through constant changes i got diagnosed with this  months ago im now getting tested for a chronic and terminal heart disease with a life expectancy of  years im monitoring my heart and my bp is getting worse and worse my brain tumour may have caused this because my brain tumour may have pushed so much cortisol that it was ruining my heart im one of those people that wished to god to give me an illness and the fact that i may have one puts things into perspective when that reality hits you head on and you realize all the things you didnt get to experience in life and now that you may not experience them you want to and you want to live i was under immense depression for  years and hid myself from society i blew off plans with friends because i just felt i wasnt worth it i skipped my friends funeral because i just hated myself so much i missed the opportunity to go on a trip with my friends to a different country because i was too self cautious and more stuff like that i shut myself off from everybody and now that i am trying to get better no one is understanding no one shows any empathy and they treat me likes its my fault for everything they tell me to reach to people for help but whenever i try to reach out to them they dont help me and with this constant urge for help and not receiving it im not caring for myself anymore i dont take my medicine for my brain tumour and im not following my doctors orders to help my heart anymore my tumour symptoms are getting worse as a result of it im scared but now im just accepting it i just dont care i feel my heart getting worse and i guess now im accepting that fear i have im just not caring but im trying but i just dont care i guess i just accepted it when the doctor told me i may have this and to watch my diet and things like that i tried but i needed people to help me and when they stopped doing and stopped caring i felt that maybe i wasnt worth the hassle for them i am a very independent person if i were able to drive and have a job i would do everything my self but since i dont i rely on others for that so when they dont help me with simple things i just feel worthless i sound so narcissistic writing this and when i do this and rely on my family to help me i feel the same because my hormones are messed up i can get very moody depressed happy etc when those episodes happen and i tell them to not pay attention to it they tell me i use my brain tumour as an excuse to get away with that behaviour those ineffable feeling of emptiness and regret just pour on me when they treat me like that or when i ask for help and they dont help me i get upset because they know how sick i am and they shrug it off because they dont experience it they dont relate and when i get mad over simple things like bringing me to the gym on their way to work so i can workout and they dont i get upset because i am sick and tired of living like this theyre my family they can help me with that but they dont i feel extremely narcissistic writing this and hate myself for thinking like this i feel disgusted that i think this some days i cant even look at my reflectionwhen i try to tell them i want a job but its just so draining and i have absolutely no energy im told im lazy and dont care i still havent graduated high school yet i skipped so much i had an attendance of  days a lot of it was due to depression and medical testings i hate that i did that and wish i could take it back i have absolutely no friends i have those few people that keep in touch every so often but an actual friend i havent had that for a while i regret not going out more and i regret letting myself stay locked in the house all day and with those friends that tried i pushed them away and i regret it i hate my body im fat and disgusting i wish i didnt stop caring for myself,3.0

64614,in the middle of a major depressive episode and i had a really good bad night ive got the kind of depression that makes me more insomniatic as it gets worse ive been on a pretty steep downhill slide mental health wise and last night was the worst insomnia ive had all year i couldnt fall asleep and worked at  i basically laid in bed awake from  to  rolling around and all that at  i decided to text my best friend and tell her that i couldnt sleep i dont really know why it wasnt like i actually expected her to respond that early in the morning it turned out that she was awake for her own reasons and we ended up just texting for an hour around  i decided to make myself some chamomile tea and do some yoga read a little the usual things to help you fall asleep i did all of those things until i could barely keep my eyes open and then laid down the second my head touched the pillow i was wide awake by now it was three in the morning and i had to be up by five anyway so i was pretty set on just staying upwhile i was laying awake in bed my best friend sent me a text saying ihop and that was that we got up and drove to ihop it was a really nice breakfast and despite our mental places and mutual lack of sleep we had some really lovely discussions we even went and adventures around walgreens at fourthe night ended with me crying in my car outside of my house as you do but overall it was nice im about halfway through my workday now and feeling it pretty heavy but it was still a nice outingi guess i just felt like sharing it was a cool way to turn something thats pretty shit right side up for a bit,3.0

64619,always confirm the relationship status of someone before you put all your time and effort into it im going to do my best to write this out before i start to fall deeper into depression and not want to write my emotions out a few months ago i got out of toxic relationship i spent weeks hating myself and wondering what was wrong with me fast forward to these last few weeks and the most amazing girlwhom ive never spoken to before messages me we start talking about work life and other things from morning till night we would talk constantly and joke around she asked to grab lunch and then breakfast at work we listened to the same type of music had tons of common interest she would bump into me and always smile at me and sit close with me she was always the mysterious type and never wanted to talk about her personal life she had made that very clear i respected that and never tried to phish for any information weeks went by and she experienced a traumatic event i tried my best to give her support she asked me for a ride home and to make sure it was safe you asked me to have dinner with you outside of work and that made me feel special my bestfriends went on a break and i shared this with her and then she finally shared something with me she shared information on her relationship and how popping the question might come up soon for her this broke me never mentioned anything about a guy in the picture there werent any pictures on her desk car phone social media where the fuck was he when she was going through shit why the fuck did she go to me why didnt i fucking just ask now im smoking again for the first time in years im such a fucking idiot ofc a girl like her would have a bf ofc im just the nice friend thank you for taking the time out to read thistldr im too naive to ask if she had a bf ,3.0

65062,high functioning depression hi everyone i hope youre having a great night excuse my formatting im on mobile to make this story short and so my question gets through quicker my grandpa passed away very recently from a misdiagnosed cancer and it has hit me the hardest anything has hit me in life since his passing last september i dont think im the same person ive never been one to deal with any sort of depression anxiety etc but ever since he passed ive found myself sleeping a lot more without a willingness to wake up to do anything ive also cried myself to sleep most nights and theres a pain in my chest that is so deep and strong that i cant sleep with it i find myself crying over very small things and have also began stress eating and gaining weight although i know that im doing all of these things i have no motivation in life to stop myself again please excuse my ignorance but what are the symptoms of high functioning depression if you have it and how do you go about it i come from a family where mental illness is not spoken about so im scared to come out and say that i need to see someone ive debated posting this online as well over and over again so please be considerate i thank you  for taking the time to read this and hopefully giving me your two cents have a great night ,3.0

65082,overwhelmed and falling apart im not really sure where to begin here or if this is even the best subreddit to post this but here it goes the past few weeks ive been steadily spiraling into a bad depression and im trying not to let it get overwhelming like it has in the past i dont know who to turn to because i dont think any of my friends or family would understand like they have in the past and also because of how guilty ive been feeling id feel better being as anonymous as possible hence the alt account i havent even mentioned this to my therapistit started when one of my work friends started talking to me about issues with her boyfriend i have a tendency to worry about people so i checked in on her a lot and was there to talk to her over that time i got to know her a lot better started to develop feelings but shes about  years younger than me its not an underaged thing i just dont feel okay with it personally i dont judge anybody in relationships like that its just not something that works for meanyway she eventually broke up with her boyfriend and the feelings have got worse we get along so great and we laugh at the same things and i dont know its like our personalities just match on some level if we were closer in age i would consider her perfect i feel so disappointed in myself but i cant deny itim not open to telling her how i feel weve become close friends and i dont want to lose that or put her in that situation i just want to stop feeling this way every moment im not occupying myself i just get overwhelmed sometimes i just want to curl up in a corner and hide forever other times i just want to punch a wall i go from sad to angry to nervous all the while trying to hide behind this facade of everything being ok normally i can say its just the depression getting the better of me but theres a tangible reason im feeling this way and i dont know how to handle it ,3.0
65083,my marriage is over so i will take my life tonight it has been a week boy oh boy has it been a week we were laying in bed together and i rolled over to kiss her and saw her texting some guy bang marriage deadit was a long time coming she says funny i dont recall seeing that impending doom hanging around the more ive thought about it and the more she has said ive realized it really was a result of my depression i was no pleasure to live with ive always had trust issues my high school sweetheart put me through the ringer and then some and i never fully recovered over a decade later doesnt matter in the slightest at this point my worst moment now isnow i was insanely jealous at times took too much for myself and didnt leave enough for her god thats the whole thing im just so mad that shes right that it was my actions and feelings and decisions that finished our relationship off im so mad that i could have changed things if i had just wised up to my own bullshiti dont have much left even after only a week my relationships with friends and family are becoming strained theres only so many requests i can ask and only so many that can be fulfilled i have a few screenplays that i am willing to a friend though he doesnt know that yet but all my other possessions will end up being hers i tried to write and usually that works when i am down on the floor not this time everything reminds me of her even something as simple as putting a pen to a page i cant carry this baggage to another relationship and fuck someone else up so what do i have left if i can never love againwhen my grandfather passed i kept the gun he had in his closet an old  from when he used to run a gang in liverpool in the  or so he said i had never put much thought to it until the other night when i figured i might as well know how to load the thing wish i hadnt now because as soon as i did i knew where i was being led its freeing in a way i no longer need to consider my future or hers no chance of running into her with someone else at our favorite tavern or hearing about it from somewhere else no more need to worry about anyone or anything until i see what is on the other sidei dont want to be a burden anymore,3.0

65711,i can only feel when i sing im not sure if anyone else feels this way i have a hard time processing emotions it stemmed from a coping mechanism due to childhood trauma and abuse it started out with just moving quickly from emotion states  abandoning painful thoughts ignoring bad experiences getting over it quickly but because the bad outweighed the good i learned to subdue my positive emotions as well i spent much of my early childhood living with an abusive relative while my parents worked i would only see my mom and dad over the weekends the only time i would be happy was when i was with my parents during the week other than being bullied at school i would spend most of my time in a closet it was a painful existence more similar to that of an animal than a human child the happier i was during the weekend the more painful it was during the week so i learned to feel nothing the higher the peaks the lower the valleys instead living in an emotional plateau was more manageable unfortunately as i grew older this coping mechanism did not end i did not know how to turn it off i still dont know how not even when i left to live with my parents full time and now as an young adult i still am unable to do much about this curse how can i be considered living if i dont feel anything at all the only thing that helps is singing to emotional songs i like to pretend that the lyrics were my own and channel the emotions of the artist and feel vicariously through them i am in so much pain it is so lonely i cannot connect on an emotional level with myself much less anyone else i want to cry but i cannot the sadness is overwhelming and yet i cannot feel a thing we are human because of what we feel right towards ourselves and each other hope passion hate anger fear love and yet what makes us human escapes me it is difficult for me to process and cling on to anything i dont even know if what i have can be called depression the only time i feel alive is when i sing i love karaoke but to others its just a good time to me its my one and only way to communicate how i feel i just wish someone could hear me and hold me and say its okay and let me cry with them if only for the length of a song but karaoke is a happy occasion and so i put on a smile have a drink dance and be a fool but inside there is nothing the great pretender  queen a difficult song to sing i wish i could sing it ,3.0

65856,just another depressed post so ive struggled with depression for ages much like everyone here but its gotten much worse in the last  months since i lost a friend to suicide he was a quiet guy quirky etc but a close friend i was obviously devastated when it happened but since it happened ive felt more and more guilt not so much because i feel like i shouldve done or said something i little bit because of that but mainly because i was on the cusp of doing exactly what he did i feel guilty because if id have done that he might still be here i also feel guilty because im almost jealous that hes gone and im still herewith the reaction that our friends and families have had i really dont think i could put them through it but i just want to not exist any more i dont really know what im hoping to achieve from this but id much rather hear from people in a similar position rather than people trying to encourage me and saying things will get better thanks ,3.0

66142,could this be depression or bpd or something else finally pulled the trigger and subscribed to this sub been trying to figure out what is up with me im a  in the us been a relatively healthy and happy child and had many good friends in hs some i still talk to but the past few years ive felt severe anxiety and maybe depression but it seems like its very variable ive been working night shifts while in school the past  years or so there are some nights i try to get out of bed and just dont want to snoozing the alarm turns to just lying there falling back asleep or just laying in the dark ive missed shifts a few a month or so and havent called and gotten bitched at for it but i barely care bc its so low paying and there was a time i worked very hard when i was gunning for a promotion i ultimately didnt get for unknown reasons despite a good interviewim in a cc for now and struggle with feeling lost barely know what i would want to do as a career find something im interested in take some classes lose the passion grades drop switch majors have done this twice already and im starting to feel the same way about my current major again i also have trouble speaking up in class and to classmates overthink everything and my hunches are usually false in this respect feel like a lost loner and like i lost all of my friends and life after high schoolthing is i know many of my thoughts are irrational trying to practice mindfulness and calming that voice since starting st johns and trying to cook more opposed to ordering out making microwave dinners pizza and pasta i feel a bit better in general but what confuses me and why i think maybe bpd is family history my ma is probably bpd or major depressive and family history of depressionanxiety i also have days often a few in a row where i feel great somewhat normal i talk to strangers engage my coworkers more and get things done but then usually the day after my most productive one and the following few days i feel lethargic sleep in excess sometimes  or more dont want to go to work and do things if i do go i usually want stay by myself withdraw from people and social obligations its a vicious cycle that is causing me great distress i know its a long winded post but thank anyone who reads it and any advice this community may have i feel like im riding a rollercoaster of emotion crawling up to happiness bliss and contentment realizing my situation is good compared to billions of others then crashing down to feeling like a pathetic fat failure who will never find a partner or ever have kids or make myself into the person i wanted to betldr feeling like my emotions swing wildly from contentment happiness and sociability to hypersomnic lazy and procrastinating never wanting to engage strangers loved ones and coworkers often spend a few days in each mood but feel like feeling down dominates with a few neutral days in between like today after a great past couple days thanks for any insight,3.0

66146,depressed student looking for any advice or wisdom hi i dont expect everyone to read all of this but if you do anything advice is appreciatedim in my early twenties and have been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last three years which has gotten progressively worse i actually recently went to a party and just felt flaring social anxiety as soon as i walked into the room i have been to psychiatrists and psychologists and doctors and havent found much success so far i feel as if my feelings of sadness are an addition of factors happening simultaneously the first one is that i am currently in my second last year of my engineering degree and its really beginning to get difficult and drain most of my time i dont naturally hate studying it but when it takes so much time and energy away from my hobbies like sport and music or even socializing i cant help but to feel  like it is draining me of my happiness at the same time i always believe in a balance and its getting harder and harder to do things i enjoy and it seems all i have going for me is this degree which wont give me satisfaction but merely just acts as a safety net the second one is i feel so isolated and alone constantly most of my friends do much easier studies and are off to jobs already and pursue many hobbies and i always feel like i couldve been just like them and lived a very fulfilling lifestyle i do have university friends but outside of university we dont really have much of a connectionfurthermore my parents i love very much but i have tried to talk to them about this but they just dont seem to understand they come from such different cultural environments to the one i was raised in and i feel like they just wont understand and any time i try to talk i just feel pushed and isolated even further ive been feeling this isolated feeling for my whole life pretty much and only recently realized that loneliness was what was really making me feel uneasy for the first  years of my life i also have never really been intimate with a woman romantically either in a relationship or not and constantly seeing couples at university just makes my tummy flip a little with disappointment in myself im not jealous but more so sad that i feel that support and connection would really make me feel better im trying to love myself more and more everyday but its increasingly difficult to deal with everything at the same time as studying and trying to enjoy my hobbies i know nothing is perfect and you really do have a choice in what you make your life but i just feel really isolated and miserable right now if any of you experience similar things id appreciate it if you comment any advice or wisdom as there no chance i can drop my studies now as im too deep in and the best chance ill have to do well it to do it the same time my classmates are taking my courses ,3.0

66198,what does one live on i guess i dont have to specify an unpleasant matter here because we all have our problems though in different forms with different names or how many times they happen because they never stop life looks like the the unstoppable eternal sway of a pendulum between suffering and boredomwhenever i feel depressed it is because of a failure to attain my goal i had an end in view and i couldnt reach it yet when still in this state of mind i cant help being tempted by this question what would really have been different if id accomplished itin all honesty there are so many things i have achieved but they due to their minuteness or usualness pass unnoticed i ate my meal  mins ago and even in this instance there is a great number of achievements i was healthy enough to eat digest i had a tongue to taste it it was hygienic so i wont get ill after my body absorbs it since then i have managed to stay alive i had my nose to smell the appetising smell of the food i had the eyes to see the vivacious colours and a long et ceterathe sun is new everyday yet i do not so much as raise my head to see and enjoy it because it happens daily would it perhaps be the same with my current failures that i would feel triumphant and exuberant for some time but then grow weary of success and find the most uneconomical bane to torture myself and what if this were not only my own situation but everyone elsesthis idea came to me today again and i really dont know its answer maybe it is nonsense or maybe it is a universal truth many people have their problems here but if they had none of them would they be completely free of suffering or would they find new obstacles and if not then create them themselves only and solely to trouble over something instead of enjoying lifecan this be our essence itself so it is not at the moment of success but through the hope of it that we live can it really be that we always hope to be happy but never will be so it is the hope of happiness we all live on and our current problems are not the real obstacle to happiness but merely reflections of the immovable truth that we will never be happy though always hoping to,3.0

66325,im lonely i hate it in  grade i dated a girl for little more than a week and ever since ive had that hole in my heart not for the person i dated but for loving someone being with someone that hole hasnt been filled and its drained me for  years nowi had a group of the outcasts more or less for awhile they started playing dampd and i was there for the first time but i lacked the quickthinking the wit the whatever it needs to play they kicked me out of those nights and ive hardly been able to talk to them since because thats been the only place that they hang out outside of school which im not a part of bc classes etcim in choir but i feel just as isolated there because im not a popular kid like the majority of them arenobody said anything to me on birthday the people i knew as friends at the time teachers nobody besides my parents which was nothing other than saying it it was the first time i legitimately considered suicide as something i would doi know what most other people think of me they think im smart but emotionless recently not when i was actively trying to talk to new people when i thought maybe id be successful i sleep all the time when really im either crying or just too sad to look up i smell like smoke because my parents smoke and i cant really do anything about it i dont feel like i can reach out to anyone because everyone already has friends nobody has a reason to become friends with me and im too socially awkwardanxiety filled to talk to people well ive tried a couple different times which has just led to failure and further reason to quit tryingi have  years of hs left i dont know if or how ill make it to the end of school im told that there are people outside hs and thats pretty much the only reason i feel any motivation anymore to keep strugglingi really just want someone one person to truly love me so i know i have a valid reason to keep making it through hsi think thats all thats wrong with my loneliness,3.0

66356,i dont want to get better we ended things this monday it was a stressful relationship no doubt she was a negative one and i wanted to help her with her depression but i think it ended up bringing me into it im one to overthink things and she isnt one to share you could see how that combo made things bad for me i was once a very happy guy and i never thought i would become this way i started drinking had problems sleeping couldnt even make myself eat properly and even turned to self harm perhaps in a way because i wanted to have more of a connection with her she self harms as well  these problems got better for a while but now that things are over im much more committed to her than she is to me and im back into the problems i genuinely cannot eat properly and i can see myself losing weight by the day i have the urge to self harm in a way i know that its very immature and its all in a pitiful attempt to get her attention i know its wrong but i really dont want to get betterevery little thing reminds me of her i open my eyes and i see her in every little thing around me little moments we shared little things we said little things i would do for her i close my eyes and i would dream of her just simply talking to her messaging her holding her hand pulling the blinds down for her to her preferred level so she would wake in the morning but not be so uncomfortable in the sunlight i miss her voice i miss her leaning on my shoulder i miss her holding my hand and lightly slapping at my wrist when she found out i cut myself i miss her telling me that im an idiot i miss her holding my hand and we promising each other we wouldnt do it again now everything seems so bleak and its like nothing to live for anymore i hate not knowing what shes up to not being a part of her life anymore i know i should get better and let her know that im worthy of her love but right now i dont even have a way to get to her  were just out of each others lives but yet she lives just upstairs and were actually so close yet so far it feels so depressing to feel that nothing i do would ever work and i cant get to herin a way i want her to know how i am right now to see if she still cares but deep down im scared that she doesnt anymorei need to get better i know but i dont want to i miss her so much,3.0

66412,ive tried  times today to get help and it all failed sometimes i really think the rules tips and tricks organizations people or whatever tell you about suicide prevention are real bullshit sometimes it just feels like its for a certain kind of person one who is just real sad or has a bout of depression maybe even some anxiety all of which can be managed and controlled with very accessible and normal resources because even then all of those things require some sort of internal will power or the ability of the person themselves to take their mental health in to their own hands pick themselves up by their bootstraps and all thatand then theres everyone else who blatantly need help maybe they even make it very very clear that they have a mental illness as i have done myself many times maybe it just shows in their appearance and so on but i cant help feeling left out on my own to control a fatal disease with the equivalent of over the counter medicationi have been suffering for  years now and it hasnt been getting any better in fact each year it gets a heck of a lot worse i first showed symptoms at  of having depression suicidal ideation  breaking things self harm and so on but it didnt get really bad until i turned  as far as i ascertained im  now for reference it doesnt matter how many times i talk or read a motivational book thats not enoughfinally finally i got a therapist after years of hopping around the shitty mental health system we have in my corner of the world and while ive had some insights ive spiraled several times i really needed to speak with my therapist today because im trying ive been making an honest fucking effort for years to live with my ailments i had an appointment i wanted to give it another go and talk this out and it was canceledi figured okay this really sucks im really upset because im trying to implement the rules she gave me to help myself i went to my partner to open up to him which is so fucking hard for me to do and again i got dismissed because he has to much work to do to listen to me talk about my issues i guess let me make it a point that i have been studying my mental degradation for years so i know how to identify my triggers i know how to track my symptoms and so on this has been without the aid of a professional because for a long time i couldnt afford it i knew things were getting bad because i was suddenly getting progressively weaker a symptom i was already feeling low because it takes me a while to get to a normal state after i have a breakdown which i did days prior food started to disgust me and all i wanted was to lay down which i did i slept when i got up i mustered up the energy to call a lifeline  apparently the lifeline only handles a specific section of society and the man said i can get you a number to which i hung upfinally i called another lifeline the national one everyone always puts in their captions youtube description boxes  and so ontheres  people ahead of meim exhausted with trying i dont want to try i want to drift away into nonexistence i want to disappear i dont want to hear garyvee or tony robins or whoever the fuck i dont want to journal my feelings i dont want to reachout or whatever the fuck that meansstarvation is the only method im comfortable enough with in taking my own life but it takes time ive been not eating in hopes of fulfilling the fantasy that i will go to sleep and wake up somewhere else the next ill try is burning charcoal but thats gonna be a hard one with the quarantine i live in a  bedroom with someone who works from home whatever i do has to work on me only me and immediately or else hell call the policehonestly fuck all of this im so tired of people telling me to do this and to do that for a severity of mental illness theyve never even experienced before im sick of people telling me to hold on and them not listening to me when i reach out to talk and the lifeline is mediocre its just a bunch of volunteers asking you questions to determine whether or not to call the police,3.0

66562,very long vent sorry i dont know if anyone has felt this but my depression seems to take different forms it melds and changes as time goes on not exactly getting better or worse just changing how it affects me when it first really started to manifest it was like a vampire was constantly draining the life out of me it was the end of middle school and within a few months i dropped everything wrestling karate my grades my friends my family gaming it was all gone i looked like a zombie that just got done a full marathon at my best i just became a disappointment because no one understood what was going on not me not my parents not my teachers not my friends no one i was cold tired and alone the one upside i wasnt an immediate danger to myself there was no self harm or thoughts of suicide around the summer after  grade i got somewhat better and  grade was nowhere as bad but of course all good must eventually come to an endin  i met a girl and we started dating now i have apparently a very grown up opinion of dating and relationships even back then i absolutely loved this girl like i could have happily lived the rest of my life with this girl unfortunately she didnt feel the same she didnt cheat or anything and was very grown up about how she went about it and to this day we are very good friends practically siblings although at the time of the brake up it was bad and to spare the details i attempted to take my own life a few months after this i had another bad episode and my two closest friends my ex and my friend of probably  years who is also and was also at the time my exs boyfriend urged me to go to the hospital and see crisis i finally did i spend  weeks in an inpatient facility and when i had to leave because of insurance no one wanted me too every single person that was within eyeshot of me in the facility thought i was too unstable to leave but no insurance meant i had to go before i continue my story i want to explain how this form of my depression was different instead of feeling undead i felt as if there was a fire within me it was like how some really want to achieve their dream or become the best at their skill except i wanted to end my life it was intense at times and it was why people at the inpatient facility thought i should stay when i was about to leave they put me on an antipsychotic to try and keep me stable until i got an outpatient doctor it sucked it actually gave me hallucinations and made me feel sick for longer than other meds eventually i got switched off of it and began to feel better but by now i know what happens when im allowed to actually start to feel happy now we get to the more recent parts of the story im a senior in highschool recently turned  and an odd sensation starts to creep over me it was barely noticeable at first but now its nearly soul crushing there is this odd sense of not belonging it feels like i just suddenly took over someone elses life i feel a fraud in my own life it feels like im not even human sometimes  i legitimately was scared because i was about to check my paycheck and i got this weird feeling in my chest and i felt kind of fidgety and  almost felt sick no i wasnt scared i had worked extra hours and i know i was going to get extra money i was excited i got a bit excited and it scared me because i didnt know what was going on at the time im so numb so often sometimes i dont even feel like im in my body its like im puppeting myself around i am the only person i know that can sit for minutes to upwards of an hour alone thinking about literally nothing i guess a question for anyone who has made it this far if you have any knowledge about it does this sound like dissociating from what i read it seems like it but i dont know it is making everything worse and might even be causing this sense of wanting to be gone to disappear not exactly of wanting to kill myself but im scared that if it keeps going on i cant see a doctor for over a month and im not sure what to doif you made it to the end of this thank you really venting like this isnt something i can do much the friends i talked about cant really handle it and any adults i could tell either wouldnt know how to respond or just make things worse so thank you for hearing me out,3.0

66668,i need your help with making a short comic about depression so i used to draw a lot when i was a child and kind of staved off it i got back to it on a digital tablet and realized that traditional paper gives me something to focus on and clears my head however theres an itch i cant scratch when it comes to this goddamn parasite in my mind i dont want to wake up every morning dreading to be alive and around people i want to be able to express that through art in some type of way i can do the drawing part but i need help on the writing i have an idea that was inspired by a post on this subreddit wherin the main character narrates how shitty life can be and decides to kill himself but upon accomplishing something small during the attempt he feels proud and finds solace in learning something new what can convey how we feel about life and how low we can get when our minds just ramble on and on without a single chain of thought what can i use or write to show that what do you think about during your work day or when youre at homeim horrible at finishing things so lets see how this goes,3.0

66886,im gonna die soon but i do not want to hello everyonei finda kinda weird to explain my personal history but i do not know what the fuck to doi was born in a normal family not rich not poor an overprotective mother made me kinda insecure about things i always have been little yet really agressive as a child plus having a huge self demand on myselfi live in a hard country to grow up i was bullied all my entire life when i was  i was bullied or ridiculized by everyone in my class they put spiders on my desk i am afraid of them they kick the shit outta of me they throw away my food always i was the bullied smart guy of the class but i get sick of it in my teenage years i started to try to be the cool kid that goes with the cool guys but i ended being a weird sidekick that still was bullied by a lot of people nothing weird though not responded love on my teenage years and shit like this  but i slowly started to develop a depression i think in my  i started to feel weird you know shit like that not like ugh life is sad i feel depressed just a bad chemical reaction on my brain thing was going shitty but i could take it then everything was going downhill like at  i was pretty ok in martial arts i was stopped being bullied too lol but i suffered a lot of injuries i had to stop i had my first girlfriend yet she commited suicide i started university yet all my friends only were one course with me some of my best friends just dissapeared of my life from one year to the other others just fall in bad life drugs problems  then at  my father died just without any context he was a special man a good humble charming and really inteligent man i love you so much dad i fuckin miss you and i know that with you everything would be great   with my dad alive everything was kinda ok at least i have my family i was raised a lot of times with my granny and i had a special connection with my little cousin she was like my daughter she only has her momma and i am the only man on the family as when she was born i was like  years old or so my dad died of stress but everything was fucked up from there on all my family turned my back on me and my mom because of the fuckin money i had no side to choose as i had no money and i was living with my mother and yet my mother started to blame my father for all the troubles my mother some one that almost did not work in her entire life started to say bad things about a man that died because of his stressfull work he was a police chief and those nightshifts are mortalbut gladly i still had connections things to go on i had university i had a girlfriend then i had work then i had sports againyet things went really ugly again i finished university i started to work i get a new girlfriend i started to do sports again but everything ended  my ex broke with me and she doesnt wanna know anything about me all because i was a closed guy because i do not want to paint dark days in her beauty life i am desperately wanting to at least end everything in a good way yet i am a fuckin monster in her eyesat my hobbies i couldnt train for months because of my late depression and i see everyone getting better and i am just getting stuck and everyone surpassing me and i am just a letter in a book an ant in a colonyand by work yeah my work is kinda stressful i am the director in a company yet i suffer from pressure from the ground workers and from my superiors it is cool that i do not have to go to a normal  job yet that kind of solitude kills mejust imagine my lifein circa five years i lost my girfriend due to suicide i do not have any friend because either they are too afraid when i open my pandora box or they go away because i am a closed human being when i asked for help to my family because of my mental problem a lot of stigmas were into me i was locked into a mental health hospital for months with  years i lost my father i was thinking to form a family with my exgirlfriend  years together yet she dumped me because almost no reason i lost all my family only i have a manipulative mother and her stupid snob boyfriend she is just a fucktoy to a rich man everyone that i knew is against me even my mother talk bad things about me i have a fucked up brainand i could go on and on and on but the hardest thing is that i could be one two three days weeks or even months without sayin anything and no one would make me a call no one would come to my house and hug me no one would smile at me say something nice without wanting anything in to return  its not just my mental health its not only my shitty live its that nobody really cares its the fact that why i should fightwhy i have to struggle with all this everyday  i have no one on my side no one to talk no one to hang out no one to go to the cinema no one to have fun no one to eat some day and that counting if i would like to,3.0

66966,i dont know what happened ive been up and down over the years so i decided to make an effort to improve my life through life style choices stopped drinking soft drink less take away more fruit and veg exercising getting out and about and for a bit it seemed like it was working i didnt feel shit all the time i was being more organised and even felt a little proud about myself then a fortnight ago i started to decline then in the past  days i went off a fucking cliff i have no motivation im always tired i struggle to focus on basic tasks i just feel numb to the world i try to do my homework or even look for a job but i always end up just thinking about whats the point existence is wasted on me no reason to care about anything suggests itself i legitimately want to kill myself and catch myself planning how to do it i have everything i think id need the following is the hardest to admit because it makes so angry at myself so fucking mad it makes me physically ill to consider that this is why i went backwards i can barely type it out weeks ago a girl i kinda liked but not really but still kinda found really very attractive but wasnt to sure about anyway girl i liked started flirting with a guy a tall guy with conversation skills and a mustache i take one look at my short bulky frame and irish potato head and hear my stuttering voice and i resign myself to the drink  hours and  beers later i was asleep while binge drinking doesnt do wonders for mental health neither does being incapable of dealing with romantic emotions this isnt the first time my complete lack of ability to cope with my emotions has resulted in me going completely off the rails it annoys me that this is all it takes for me to go thats like girl  youve properly crushed on and made no real attempt to go out with may as well just die i may end up just telling her i like her letting her reject me and then moving on theres a level of uncertainty still involved here that some part of my emotions are grasping too now im just typing what crap pops into my head i realise compared to some people this is rather trivial but i couldnt sleep and wanted to gather my thoughts and calm myself ,3.0

66976,i was abused and i honestly see no value in my life anymore im going to preface this with one important fact ive been beaten and abused since i was a really young kid before i was able to comprehend languages and recently got out of a domestically abusive relationshipi used to live on my own with my now ex boyfriend i started dating him when i was  and he was  by the time i was  turning  we had been moved in together in our own apartment as he gradually became more abusive and started letting his friends use hard drugs in the house i left i had to call my father to come get me and take me in so that i wouldnt be such a fucking miserable sack of shit my boyfriend at the time broke my patella and dislocated my leg so i was in a cast for about  months before i could physically leave people laugh at that situation all the time i cant tell which is worse the laughing from people or the people that look at me with disgusting pity in their eyes and telling me that they were so so sorry it happened and then quizzed me on why i didnt reach out to the police i did the local shelters had no resources to take someone in that was in a cast and the children at all of the shelters wouldve impeded my ability to heal due to their constant running around and activity in the cramped shelter space their words not mineim  im stuck living with my father because all of the upward mobility in my life was stripped away from me due to being abused i feel like it was my choice to leave all of the friends i had made and my job which wasnt too bad when it came to dealing with my fucked up leg i dont know what to do im really close to ending it all i dont have an out my current boyfriend is trying to be supportive but he keeps procrastinating on helping me pick apartments and trying to help me get my drivers license my mom never let me have one because she told me i was a stupid cunt that didnt deserve to drive and my ex didnt have a license either because his parents never thought that teaching him to drive was important i feel like im trapped in being a teenager i really cant take it my dad forces me to do chores that are physically uncomfortable even when ive told him multiple times that it hurts my boyfriend never listens to me and literally stops me mid word or mid sentence just to be able to speak over me all the time i have literally nothing to live for  i cant keep a job because of my fucked up leg i cant get my dad or my boyfriend to treat me nicely ive already told my boyfriend that if he doesnt stop im leaving him because i cant fucking take it and i cant get out because i dont have a license or a stable job because i am literally in the midst of filing for disability and ive heard filing can take forever i realistically have less than  months if my conditions dont improve dramatically and soon tbh i dont think theres really anyone can do at this point to get me to stop planning on suicide,3.0

i smoke i drink party always beautiful people are coming and going i always in love with that place my favorite place in turkey so at the end of the season most people left the valley and i was staying with a friend at the whole camp owners let us to stay the problem was we were out of water i didnt have so much money cuz you have to buy water from villagers over there we decide to carry water from the fountain which is really close to our camp i was carrying every   days like  litres x   i didnt realize my body got weak at these days because i didnt eat well last couple days by the way i am tall like  foot  inches  cm and always been love playing following basketball and was doing regular exercises during the season not everyday but every   days anyway i hurt my back during that water carrying unfortunately i realized little something when i was there didnt care too much kept goingafter the valley and season is over in november i came back to istanbuli need to make money

my pain he was trying to help me calling me to the hospital i was crying to himi became a walking dead cannot enjoy anything cannot smile cannot do things i want i got starting to think about leaving this body i also started to little bit limping when i walk when i look at it my mind was going crazy and stillcause of these pains i decided to try acupuncture after  sessions i got my first sleep since january i was in tears after  sessions more i cut it because of the energy of doctor i feel is he is gonna keep me calling for next session i dont want my all money go but anyway my whole perception is changed i envy people who can sit normal i forgot to chill on a sofa or just lay down and relax i started to thinking how and when it is gonna get cured is it gonna get cured  no it is not i have to take care of it all my life i started to think how am i gonna travel with my backpack how am i gonna work again how am i gonna play basketball my body is fucked up during that processi became obsessed and depressedit is a long process i am limping when i walk i cannot lean forward cause of my back muscles shortened i can sleep but still got pain through my leg and feeling not good about my back these thoughts trapped me up so bad i turned off my phone and not talking to anyone i became suicidal i started to think heavily to jump off from  floor which i cant because i am afraid for surei ve been to my parents house to stay i am depressed as hell when i open my eyes i was starting to cry immediately i was calling my dad to my room and crying like a baby hours  i was going to a park and crying i think myself and i start to crying how this happened to me cause of these heavily sadness and stress i got my lymph nodes got swollen never experienced a thing like that and they hurtbecause i cannot suicide and only way i saw was starting medication which ive withdrawn already i start taking prozac xanax and seroquel my old friends seroquel is for proper sleep and not waking

found a gym near my parents house i started to go swimming there and doing the exercises which my psychotherapist gave me i cant lift any weights cause of my back and i also scared just keeping my mind busy like this got mri last week waiting the results gonna go another doctor and start rehab again i hope this limping is permanent because this hernia is pressuring nervesthis hernia fucked up my life i dont know how am i gonna be the same person i like to walk and climb and stay in tents partying festivals travel etc everything i want to do now becomes like i cannot do with this back anymore i dont know how and when is gonna get cured just trying to get normal since monthsi try to get motivated by see and search people who have worst diseases and pains i tried everything just be

67221,as someone who struggled with anxiety panic attacks and one strong bout with depression you can heal and get better heres my story i think ive always been anxious it might be genetic it might be hormonal who knows but i know it always lay under the surfaceapproximately three years ago after tripping negatively on about  of edible weed i got hit by anxiety and ive had anxiety and panic attacks ever since its like it just set something off but if im honest i had some other high stress and emotional shit that went on around that same time like my dog who was my best friend died  my grandma got put into home i started fighting with my mother  my wife got pregnant again my work was having trouble etc i had no idea what it was in the beginning i thought i was going insane and losing my mind this made me doubt my sanity and everything else it also made me have terrible health anxiety i worried about everythingthis eventually set off a bout of depression again with this i had no idea what was happening i just didnt feel anything or i felt blue and sad like i was grieving for myself it was scary i didnt contemplate suicide but i did think about it i specifically remember coming home each night and one of the things i did most nights was read to my daughter and it was all always satisfyingi just didnt feel good even doing this so i resented myself even morei knew i had to do something the anxiety panic attacks and depression were becoming too muchi was also drinking far too often and heavily this made things worseso i did what everyone else does went online and saw my gp he said it was general anxiety i was going through some shit he said i needed to lose weight eat better and check back with him he offered me mental health assistance too around this time i also started to exercise regularly again by swimming so i kept that up drs orders started to experiment with diets and looked into a range of other things slowly but surely my depression just fizzled awaymy anxiety and panic attacks have stayed but been reduced significantly to the point ive gone  months without an issue recently put it this way i no longer call the ambulance and get hospitalised for thinking im having a heart attacki put down my reduction in anxiety and panic attacks and solution to depression by i started exercising regularly and lost weight  my exercise consisted of hiking and swimming and sauna dont ask me why i consider that last one exercise lol  eating healthier ive always eaten ok because we grew up eating mainly home cooked and my family always grew their own vegetables but there where things that were shit about my diet this took me the most amount of time to figure out what works for me so much bs out there i stick to a pretty common sense diet i try to eat clean most of the time meaning fruits vegetables fish  wholemeal and whole grain unprocessed carbs brown rice  oat milk or organic cows milk grass fed organic meat  organic free range eggs and i kind of intermittent fast about  of the week where i skip breakfast and lunch or have a late lunch believe me when youre hungry feelings of depression and anxiety get beaten by hunger if only temporarily ive always taken some kinds of natural supplements but i really researched the ones that have been proven time and time again to assist with mental health and the ones that came up which i take and try to religiously are vitamin d actually a hormone  not only does it help with calcium absorption but theres a ton of new research on it effecting sex hormones estrogen and testosterone but also all the feel good chemicals in the brain such as serotonin and gaba fish oil thousands of studies and great for overall health heart brain etc and its mildly anti inflammatory which is a whole other topic magnesium a well known muscle relaxer and apparently most of us are deficient in it and finally turmeric must have pepper in it again i take this for anti inflammatory  reasons and these effect stress and mental health  which leads me to inflammation its now a heavily studied health topic and is being linked to all sorts of serious health problems including depression  pretty much from what i can tell all parts of the body create and or are effected by inflammation its caused mainly by diet and lifestyle choices but also because of hormonal dysfunction i try to eat anti inflammatory foods and when i do eat inflammatory foods i make a mental note that im in a deficit and work to get it back call me crazy but i feel different when im inflammed i feel tight back is sore breathing feels like theres more effort  i feel bloated etc  my daily check how do i feel if i feel shit i check things off  have i had enough sleep enough water  good healthy food have i had my supplements do i feel inflammed  how are my emotions how are my relationships  am i stressed out and why have i been outside and gotten fresh air and light have i exercised  of the time if i feel shit theres something missing from this list  not taking life too seriously i can get worked up real easily and ive always been a go getter in my family im always the one off organising things at work i used to go at projects like a pit bull and even when im at home i find it hard to sit around for more than a day just chilled end up cleaning doing maintenance gardening etc  which is all weird because i was basically a pot head hippy traveller in my younger days  meditating i used to meditate religiously twice a day  ive since had kids  bought a house  work full time and its hard but if i sneak in even just a  minute non guided breathing meditation in the morning it just sets the tone to my day  having meaning in my life so for me i never really thought about it but my meaning has always been to experience life to have adventures and to learn this is all great because it doesnt pressure me to get anything out of money or work or my loved ones it keeps all that separate you can experience life as a homeless person or a billionaire i only recently asked my gp for meds because if i do get a panic attack which is rare nowadays i want to be able to nip it in the bud immediately because i know what it is and i mostly know why its there but i just need a hand seducing it into calm i was given valium and some other shit that made me feel stupid and clumsy i stopped taking the latter and the valium has been great when ive needed it this is partly psychological too eg i know i have something there if i need itfinally two things i need to do which ive kinda kept in my back pocket are seeing a mental health expert and getting my hormones checked i know for a fact there are hundreds of mental health programs out there not just therapists and psychologists one particular one i keep looking into is the linden method and regarding the hormones i recently learned of dr mark gordon who treats tbi and mental health issues with natural hormones and has massive success this part is psychological because its like im telling myself i have options thats pretty much it i think you guys that have battled depression for as long as you have are true warriors i really mean that dont give up fuck depression you are a brilliant human beingi dont know you but i love you peace out anyone having a hard time dm me anytimeedited added  ,3.0

67264,im so lonely i just burst out crying ive never been a very popular guy when i was a child in mexico i would get bullied to no end from my extended family and kids in school it left from what i can tell a very permanent mark in me where i dont see myself as valuable or important when i moved to the us this werent too different i had some bullying problems due to my lack of english skills i made some friends but they would all leave our wed drift apart this was pre internet dayshigh school came along and things seemed to be getting better i was fit had a regular group of friends and my grades though not great they were passable one of my friends eventually became my girlfriend and we were together for  yearsis been  years since then and i havent really recovered i moved out from my parents home a few months ago which is a good thing but im still missing that human interaction you only get with a significant otherive had a lot of tragedies happen lately as well one of my aunts was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer she wont talk about to me much but she has a tumors and there is nothing the doctors can do about my grandfather passed away less than a month ago i had to go down to his funeral in mexico where i was berated with questions of why i didnt visit why dont i keep in touch with them and if i dont love them my friend and roommates mother just got diagnosed with terminal cancer as well this has been an ongoing battle for her and the doctors are saying that at this point she might as well just live her life comfortably my cat ran away from my parents home and few days ago i was told that she was found dead last but not least i reached out to my best friend to see if he could come over play games or what have you this weekend but i was met with extreme negativity from him i asked what was wrong pretending i had nothing wrong in my end and all i got a reply saying to not talk to him im laying in bed staring into my ceiling in the darkness i thought about what i want for myself in life and how impossible it all seems when i talk to people and ask them how i would go about finding a partner they tell me that i just need to go out and itll happen im not trying to make excuses but when i do go out i cant seem to find anyone to talk to theyre all in groups and the idea of approaching a woman scares me since ive been told that women dont want to be approached theyre taught that im here to rape them and men only want one thingsorry about the somewhat long post if you read through this while thing thank you and i hope your day is going better than you hoped,3.0

67287,my worst state yet i have just turned  and am a junior in high school i can say with confidence that i have very bad anxiety it keeps me from talking to people and doing certain things but thats not the point here the point is i have slipped into my worst depressive episode yet so lets get into iteveryday i do the same things in the same places with nothing new ever happening i walk through the hallway at school with my earbuds in and talk to no one if one of my friends ask me how im doing i say fine and make them laugh with me so it seems like im alright this not the way i have always lived though i have hung out with friends talked to a ton of people throughout my day and checked in on people who i dont talk to much i have put good hearted energy into my relationships and i never received even half that energy in return i have given up trying to engage with my friends when all they do is leave me on read or keep me around for my drugs or to make them laugh this is why i have slipped into this cycle of laying in my bed thinking back on what i could have done different to make my life better or make people enjoy my company the monotony of my life is slowly killing my spirit today alone i could barely muster the energy to speak my parents continuously asked me if i was upset about something and it took all my energy to fake my response to themwhat has truly broken my spirit is the feeling that no one will ever care about me the way i care for them i have put some much time and money into friends that wont do shit for me or will shame me for not helping them out or buying shit for them even my parents will give up on asking me how im doing or what i do in my spare time id say the daily ridicule about the way i dress act and my appearance doesnt exactly help any of this either the worst part about trying to open up to people is that they always say im fine because im smart or because i have nice clothes or a nice car none of that matters to me my possessions bring me zero joy music doesnt feel the same i could care less about my video games or phone or computerthe main reason i havent taken my own life is because i refuse to believe that there isnt something that will give me a purpose in life,3.0
67288,i have no friends getting really depressed male  i am extremely lonely dont have any friends at all i am very outgoing confident positive and fitdecent looking but none of my past friendships lasted long when i had few friends i always initiated lunchdinnermovies and covered all their bills but no one has ever invited me out or cared about me i always had a different way of thinking never agreed with the majority and was always into sciencecomputersnature because of that i was bullied on a daily basis as a kid without any friends at the age of  i started reading and i used to spend my entire weekend inside different libraries reading  books weekly on average i did not live with my parents until i was  at the age of  i was sent to a special boarding school due to my severe adhd and started living with my parents again when i was  when i was  i left my parents and came to this country alone for my american dream i am russian jewish at the beginning due to the language barrier i felt like shit going to school everyday without understanding anything one of the hardest part was that when teachersstudents ask me stuff i had no choice but to say yes to literally everything people used to laugh at me all the time because of that thinking i am mentally challenged or something that humiliation made me extremely strong i started talking to old people in my neighborhood and asking them to teach me english most of them were very bored and they were more than happy to help me out soon after i decided to get a part time job my parents gave me enough money for about  months i had to start supporting myself but most places rejected my application due to my english after countless rejections i landed a job at a local starbucks manager of the store was also an immigrant i think she just felt bad for me and decided to give me a chance at the beginning i was only tasked to clean until i improved my english through this job i made countless amount of connections and my english improved dramatically after a year arriving to this country i finished all of my esol programs that would have taken  years to complete and i went on and finished english  within a year i was given a special permission to take all those courses concurrently as an esol student you dont have to take english  in order to graduate i graduated from high school with  average and scored  on my sat exam gpa could have been higher but i really struggled at the beginning without understanding anything right after my graduation i started to work as a freelance programmerweb designer also started investing and made quite a lot of money for my age and soon enrolled at a local community college last year september i started my entrepreneurship journey forming a tech startup and after countless failures i finally got one investor who is willing to investi recently got my acceptance letter to one of the most prestige university but i decided to take a year off to see how far i can go with my startup i currently work more than  hours a week on my startup and when i am free i usually keep myself busy by reading every year i challenge myself to read as much as bill gates would or more i just want to be with someone who cares about me willing to support me emotionally and i am willing to offer the same and even more in return but i dont even have that ive been really depressed lately because of this i just feel empty and something is missing i didnt really grow up with my parents like the other kids and i was bullied a lot when i was a kid when i moved here i used to attend all school events myselfincluding parents night graduation etc i was never really lovedcared by anyone throughout my life all i want is to be loved and cared i am very emotionally strong i have hard times crying even if i really try never had any suicidal thoughts i always tell myself that i am strong and i can achieve anything that i want to achieve and i always see failureshardships as an opportunity for me to improve however this constant feeling of nothinglonelinessemptiness is slowly tearing me apart and i dont know how much longer i can holdin real life as ive mentioned i am extremely emotionally strong and dont like giving my weakness away to anyone not even to my doctor unless if its my friendgirlfriend that i really trustcare and they are the same to me but i dont have that and never had onethats why i have decided to put this on reddit anonymously to get this burden removed from my heart ,3.0

67368,feeling down and getting high hey there never posted here before but just feeling down again today catching a buzz feeling lonely just wanted to get this off my chest if you read this thank youive had a very bad past few years i failed out of college because im young and stupid and did not take it seriously enough ruining my chances at achieving my dreams after that i became incapable of making any good decisions its not like i dont understand that they are wrong but in the moment i seldom realize what ive donea couple years ago i also developed a health issue one that is embarrassing and has utterly ruined my confidence this issue has also resulted in a lot of surgery i have had four surgeries broken up by long periods of recovery where i should not be on my feet i almost fear love right now because i am a coward i know i shouldnt be i dont want to be but i amthat said i ignored the doctors advice during recovery the first two times not entirely ignored it but didnt follow it to the t you know this may have contributed to my failure to heal each time but its a bummer to think youre a fool that said the last two times i have followed there instructions fully and still havent healed so maybe ive been cursed ive grown to hate myself quite a bitive also lost a lot of friends recently i feel like i was targeted that ive done nothing wrong but i wonder if thats just because im a bad person ive thought about that a lot recently like maybe i just have this huge ego and thats why everyone hates me maybe my ego is what made me make this post whether it really is my fault or not it sucksi do still have one good friend and smoking marijuana has helped me a bit it can pull me out of an episode sometimeswriting this has made me feel good if you read this thank you,3.0

67370,im depressed and i think my mother is the reason so to begin with since im    years old i have started to think about suicide in my life theory life is pointless so the only reason to live for me is to enjoy life since about  years though i have had shorter but also longer periods of time where nothing was fun anymore thats when i started to think about taking my lifethis came to a peak about  weeks ago since then until now absolutely nothing has given me joy anymore and that was kind of new for me because in past times when i was on a low i always found something to get my mood back upbut with this situation i came to a realisation if nothing brings joy into my life nothing really matters nothing i do can change the situation so it doesnt matter anymore only one thing matters when will i end it and thats how the past few weeks looked like for me i just wake up at  eat think about death and fall asleep againnow yesterday i was thinking about it why now why the last few weeks and not earlierso i was starting to think about the situation and when it all really started what the cause of all this wasthen i had the conclusion to all of this my momso to make things easier to understand you have to know some things about me and my motheri was always a person who had the desire of freedom independency and privacy this stood and still stands in direct conflict with how my mother treats meshe always needs to know what im doing there is no privacy i have the feeling in order for her to feel that im safe she has to be in control of everything quick reminder im  also she always things that her way of life is the best and she thinks she knows what the best way of life for others is now of course she would never admit this but she really lets it hang out most of the time those two characteristics lead to a deadly mixture when it comes to me i always feel supervisioned by my mother if i want to have privacy i need to go somewhere she isnt if i tell her what i have planned or what i might want to do and she thinks it doesnt suit me shell let me know but not in a way of giving me her opinion about it more like the more often she tells me maybe itll change meit begins with the coffee in the morning and ends with my choice of what i studysince  years every time i put a fucking sugar cube in my coffee shell let me know that she doesnt like that every morning morning like in groundhog day basically what that causes is that i slowly stopped caring about my moms opinion it dont care if shes right or wrong anymore it doesnt matter because when she tells me her opinion she doesnt try to help me she forces her opinion of the imaginary perfect way of life on memy dad sort of feels the same way and tries to support mehe talked about how i should figure out my own life and shouldnt be pressured by my mom to life a life i dont want to at first i thought he was wrong about my mom but now i think what he said became realitynow when puberty started for me i could never understand kids that would rage at their parents telling them their opinion rebel and so on i was always trying to be nice and chill but in order for that to work i could tell my mom anything in order to have no conflict and thereby neither my dad which worked out but that meant that i could not show my personalityso when i got my first pc with  years that was where my life was when i was at home i had a couple of really close friends where i could go to but when i was at home my pc was the only place i could be at feeling free of my time i didnt live the life i wanted i just said and did things to avoid conflict mainly with my motherso to bring this into the context of why i feel depressedthis is probably the first reason why i never really had any conflict with my mom the past years the trade of is that i feel kind of empty i dont really feel that i have a personalityevery part of my personality since i was  was just a show to fit inanother cause of my depression is that i started to let my mom know that i dont trust her and that i dont want to hear her opinion i know that i hurt her by reacting abherent which made me feel that i dont deserve her affection regardless of the stuff she still loves mein an article ive read that one reason of a depression can be that the person thinks he doesnt deserve affection and love this is where i started to think that im depressivewith that said my only hope for things to change is that i move out but there are some problems with thatproblem n° its not gonna happen in the next couple of weeks unless i move to my dad he offered me to move in and i think im going to do that the next week or soproblem n° my mom will still have this negative kind of influence on me because we would still have close contact i dont want my life to be negatively impacted by her on the other hand if i give her a cold shoulder it could possibly worsen my depressive feelingsi cant just tell my mom the situation im in she would be in denial and tell me that im creating all those problems by myselfmy questions areshould i move to my dads houseshould i tell her about itshould i tell my dad about itis it helpful to

67375,why do parents teach you not to cry when i was younger my mother taught me not to cry because according to her it was a sign of weakness and showing vulnerability was admitting defeat yes thats literally what she said she taught me this ever since i could speak and would hit me over and over again to make me stop crying when i was just a kid so i was always afraid to cry in front of my mom because instead of comforting me like other moms do she would scold me until i stopped i think she did this so she could make me stronger but instead it crippled my life completely im still afraid to cry even after all these years even when im alone its like i was never taught to cry in comfort and vent out my feelings it drives me crazy because all this emotional frustration just piles up inside of me and stays there people say its an unhealthy coping mechanism but for me it isnt even a coping method i was just taught now i cant even go to my mom for therapy because she believes that mental illness should be overcome without the help of medications or psychiatric help and just shakes off my problems as trivial in comparison to others i bet she would flip if she found out i was suicidal because if that isnt a sign of weakness in my mothers eyes i dont know what isps just in case people assume im a guy im not i know this is more common among males because of toxic masculinity so just clearing things up,3.0

67501,ive never felt this way before and im not sure what to do up until maybe  weeks ago i was feeling myself i was able to balance work school and developing a relationship with this amazing girl i work with but all of a sudden everything got so out of control and i dont know what to do and its affecting every part of my life i can no longer balance my homework load with my work schedule and my grades have started to go to shit i hardly show up to class anymore and im failing  out of my  classes and the worst part is i dont even care i hate school and would take a break if i could  but i would never go back if i did i have no motivation to continue to get my degree i get  sometimes  hours of sleep max because im so stressed out with how my life has been going and it leaves me with no energy or motivation to do anything of value the only thing that was keeping me going was this girl seeing her was the best part of my week and thats always what i look forward to but she has been worried about my mental health and its been hurting her to see me this way because im not the same guy i was when we started talking so she decided we needed to take a break from dating to figure out our mental health as individuals rather than a couple were still going to talk just not date and its hurting me more than ill let her know because she has a lot going on and she doesnt need any more on her plate either i cant fathom the fact of seeing her less because she is one of the best things in my life at the moment i dont even like to spend time with my family anymore i spend all my time in my room doing what i can to take my mind off how i feel after i get home from work i go straight upstairs to play xbox or draw tonight was the first time that ive had food that my mom cooks in what seems like a week and i didnt even eat with my family they had to bring my supper to work and i ate alone i feel like im so disconnected from those who were closest to me all because i dont want them to see how i actually feel and i make such an effort to hide things from them so i seem ok im numb to everything and its affecting my relationships the only thing that keeps me from getting any worse is the people i work with including the girl i like there are  people that i work with that make me feel incredibly valued and help me feel better there were times at work today where there were tears in my eyes because i was happy with my situation for a change and i had to go somewhere they wouldnt see because even they dont know im struggling so bad but i appreciate them in ways they will never even know im not contemplating suicide or anything like that im just in a bad place mentally and i dont know what to do,3.0

67640,i need some advices skip to question paragraph if you dont want to read i now its long sorry hello i am  and im italian ill try to be as coincise as i can be i have been living repressed life since my childhood my mother that now is getting better has been schizophrenic until a couple years ago she had various mood disorders depression paranoid thoughts and a pregnancy that went wrong before me i found out when i was a kid about this last thing and she was angry that i saw that obviously but as many other episodes a kid doesnt rationalize things he just absorb them for how they are presented to himother than that i found out that she never wanted me obviously in my subcoinscious i felt bad about myself but at the time i didnt give much importance to it she treated me very badly i even have two distinct memories of me in the stroller where she told me that i looked like an idiot she insulted me at times and even physically harassed me not sexually i was bullied in elementary school middle school and first three years of college even by two teachers one because i asked one help and she told in front of all the class that i was just a lazy fucker and a poor little child in offensive ways another one was just not really fond of my ideas about my futuristic thoughts and called me an idiot who just sits all day in front of a computer and that things like artificial intelligence were just fiction  i was just  but i was seeing even further than the technology of today and i was so eager to learn all of that instead i just got demolished by everyone never had a real close best friend but because i wasnt able to for a period i was a very active science reader and studied many things aswell until i was  when my existensial and introspective thoughts lead me to a philosophical depression aswell i lived with my parents until i was  i often went outside to see some of europe so i wasnt much at home anyway since i was  and in italy you know the majority of the population lives with their parents even in their adulthood until you have kids and parents buy you a house its just a different culture so some years i have lost just going around to see if there was a place where i could feel better but it was inside that i felt without a place to call homei am sorry i didnt have the strenght to stay on my views about things or go forward with my vision but i didnt have the energy to do that too because between my mother bullism and practically nonexistent father that just wanted me to study hard repressing all my creativity and thoughts he worked all day to not see my mother and instead left his child with her and her torments she even came to my room at night very often talking to me about nonsensical things of her paranoia i now have sleep disorders a bit of social fobia and i am very depressed i have a wonderful girlfriend that i love very much but sometimes i cant give her all the love that i feel because a part of me is always in the dark inside me there are so many things i would like to express but i just cant do things in a happy way i want to get out of this state i cant even look for a job because i work as a trader from my home since  years and it has been decent but i would like to go out there and do other things aswell but maybe this staying inside has made my social problems worse i have some friends so thats ok i went to the gym between  and  years i dropped out because of my shoulder and now even after trying hard to reestablish a routine i just cant do it and i feel defeated in that time i was with a girl that was not good at all for my mental state and to think i was the one who helped the otheri talked about my past because i recently started to feel very badly and i asked myself why and obviously here is part of the answer i have always been kinda depressed since i was a kid my teenage years were made of isolation and just thinking with myself i thought i was just different but maybe its not just thati know my story is just like everyone elses and i dont feel like i deserve something more than others i just want to be different than what i am but i cant do it alone and i was always alone not even my relatives helped me when i was a kid or younger even if they knew question paragraph a psychiatrist i saw told me i should just get some therapy and there are no real worries that i am very intelligent and there are no worries that i will become like my mother or that symptoms will get worse but i feel differently after me asking again she told me to get some cipralex and another tryciclic antidepressant for sleeping the other day i was reading so much negative effects of cipralex and i know every medicine has its downsides but im scared because some are like  cases i already lost my hair lol but i dont want to lose my erection too and if i would want to stop using that i read that it can be really hard and i would have to use it for a year at least i read many positive things aswell of course she suggested it because i told her i cant feel anything at all anymore anhedonia i am never happy even if i laughs with friends eating feels good sometimes but its getting like its nothing and as these examples so are many other things if you would hear me talking its like a flat line of sound no emotion at all i had a great self esteem before since a couple years i have nonei dont play guitar anymore its been  years i dont listen to music because it only makes me cry i dont like videogames as i used to i bring my gf to trips and i like seeing new things but it gives me nothing i would like to read so many things but i cant focus i have to read pages like three times because my mind just never stops i cant learn things because i cant focus like i should but i have a very responsive mind and i often helped my girlfriend she studies engineering i had to drop university aswell because i couldnt concentrate at all and some years ago there wasnt this great culture about other methods and i recently tried these other things that can help focussing but im pretty sure its not that safe to always use them even if many people doi have felt very repressed for all my life i dont want to be repressed by myself aswell and i already did that the point is that i want to do more with my life i just cant do it and i cant find help anywheredid someone have a similar experience or experience with antidepressants and can fade some of my fears about them how should i use them what i can do to go on with little steps i dont know any suggestions would be

67725,shouldve kept quiet so ive had a stormy year with one friend i have told her before that i have depression but shes grown up in such culture which doesnt really accept it you know to her depression  being sad itll pass when you come party with me and my friends im sometimes sad too but i just start doing stuff i like etc ive tried to tell her i just dont enjoy those things anymore we saw on other occasions though like having lunch or tea or so by mutual invites but its still been very overwhelming i know i shouldnt because she didnt understand all the facts but it made me feel like a failure well some time ago after a fight we had i felt like i needed to explain why i felt so attacked and anxious by some of her actions i sent her a link to one song telling that its a great description to whats going on in my head im sorry i wish i wasnt like this but this is me i think it finally made her realise im not only feeling blue but i felt like all she got from that was to get a winning status over the fight she didnt apologise for her own behaviour or anything after that she hasnt really been inviting me anywhere only to help her if she needs me to do something in her home when shes out of town if weve met its been  of the cases my idea she almost daily keeps telling me of the fun shes currently having or planning to have with her other friends though not once has she asked me how im doing not looking for attention like that but id have thought shed at least once ask me since its been months i did tell her i needed some space pretty often so i guess thats what caused her not to invite me anywhere anymore i feel like this is a very toxic friendship it makes me feel like my head is filled with poison fortunately i have other good friends im just not able to see them that often,3.0

67785,it really sucks when your partner doesnt see your progression hey everyone first time poster here i dont know if this is the right place to post this but i just had a quick vent and hardship experience ive struggled with depression for about  years now and especially these past couples of months i thought i was doing okay ive been off antidepressants for about a year and  and my partner and i just had a fight where theyve been arguing they are my rock and that well get through this rough patch weve been together almost  years and i thought i was doing really well these past couple of months especially off medication so its really disheartening to hear that they think its just a rough patch and that its been a constant struggle on my end and constant uphill battle trying to be positive and supportive to them they kept saying that theyre happy that im off antidepressants and once i get a job i can start smoking again which they argue helps my depression but ive been trying to hard to work on it without substances and just be happy in general depression is already hard enough without the feeling that your partner resents you and im struggling a bit so i appreciate anyone taking the time to read this thanks in advance,3.0

67855,depressed daughter refuses to go to school i have been reading this community off and on for a long timei have had off and on depression my whole life and constant severe anxietyunfortunately my daughter developed depression around age  she was in the psych unit last summer for suicidal ideation and put on ad which did not help she refused to take them anymore about  months ago shes  nowshe also has some degree of psychosis not clear yet how severe it is or could be so is also dxed schizoaffective she is refusing to go to school spends most of her time in bed cant do schoolwork she says one of the school staff is stalking her  she isnt this is the psychosis talkingthis is all coming to a head because having experienced depression as a teen myself i know how crushing the pressure of being expected to function academically while depressed can be but her father thinks shes being lazy and that im indulging her enabling her by letting her stay home on bad daysright now she is in an academically intense private school she hates it and cant keep up i support her going into a homestudy program or the local public high school where the pressure will be less but again her father says this is enabling her and shes just lazy manipulativei am at a loss here how to proceed she has agreed to try medication again but it will take a while to work if it works at allher therapist she sees a sw every week also agrees she needs to consider an alternative school setting than where she currently isalso if she continues to miss school at the rate shes going we could face legal trouble for truancymy question is how do you wish your parents had reacted to your depression while you were in high schooli was lucky enough to have parents who put me in a school setting that i could function in it was an alternative arts centered private schoolthanks for reading and any ideas you might haveeta she isnt being bullied just hates the school and cant keep up with the expectations,3.0

67921,feel like i wasted my time i hope someone can tell me i was wrong i havent been diagnosed but pretty sure i have anxiety and the girl im talking about has anxiety and depression or at least it seems that way im pissed right now so ive considered that she may be one if those lying for attention im probably wrong ill never tell her that but it helps me right now i posted a little while back about how i had been talking to this girl for a month but had known her for years her previous boyfriend left with the if you dont see a future for yourself how can you see a future for us line  ish months ago only making it worse that he said someday ill marry you she has this vent account thats where i saw all this i wasnt supposed to know about it no one was i found it and damn near had a panic attack looking at it so naturally in my panic state i looked at everything i wish i hadnt i got advice to leave her alone i shouldve listened i asked if she wanted to talk and she said i dont want to talk right now and later you really dont want to be around me right now im this dumb teenager that just read about depression and thought i knew what was going on i figured i just needed to show i cared and be consistent i texted a paragraph or  everyday because im an anxious bastard and i adored this girl spending a total of an hour out of my day to improve hers even when she wasnt going to respond was nothing to me at first it was just compliments and encouragement the stuff you are told to send by every tips list out there she didnt seem to mind that i said if she wanted me to stop texting her to tell me multiple times throughout all this she never did recently there were posts along the lines of i wish we could be more and i wish this feeling was mutual on her vent account i still go to it as she doesnt talk to me and i still want to know shes ok i thought that in the interest of pursuing my own interests for a moment and being entirely transparent i would tell her how much i cared and adored her she never responded to that but she seemed to be doing things in real life in response but still not talking to me i told her how beautiful she was on the days she dressed up and put in effort and she continued to do so more regularly all the way to today i told her that even though it was silly i got jealous when she talked to other guys today she talked to only girls my close friends and a gay guy all while still not talking to me the fact that i poured my heart out and got no response though really pushed my anxiousness to the edge though today i asked her to just tell me flat out whether she had feelings for me or not she said i dont have feelings for you the way you do for me you constantly messaging me annoys me because i thought i made it clear i didnt want to talk but you keep sending messages i was extremely hurt because i had said explicitly to tell me to stop if it was annoying and i had only been annoying by trying to make her day better i get that its probably my fault i misunderstood her but ive never felt this strongly for anyone i stopped myself from getting feelings for her for  years because i wanted to get to know her first once i did it was amazing we texted everyday before i found out and talked and laughed in person i realize that may have been an act she always seemed to be hinting at the fact that something was wrong in the texts saying she was tired and she called herself boring once then i found the stupid account and as i live life on some stupid fucking honor system i told her as soon as possible then this bullshit ensued i tried so hard gave it everything i had to make her feel like i genuinely cared because i always had i just dont show it now i feel like a fool ive been heartbroken before but never like this i couldnt do anything in person because she wasnt talking to me she would if i said something directly to her but i took her not wanting to talk literally as she didnt want to have to think of anything to say to me i bought her a valentines gift already but i guess thats fucked i really fucking hate myself right now i might consider self harm or suicide but im a coward and couldnt do that to my family if i was brave enough to top it all off i think she cut herself for the first time in weeks tonight and it feels like my fault no proof but she posted on her vent account for the first time in  days and it was about cutting i need to know of i can salvage something from this even if its not a relationship i am the only person she doesnt hate that knows the other is her ex who she at least acts like she hates now she might hate me too i dont know how to help o was too damned impatient to wait until she was ready to talk again i see her for hours at a time each day and it drives me crazy i need some hope im losing grip on my emotions and logic a combination i dont know if i can function without im so mad im worried ill swing at someone if they look at me tomorrow advice if you can pleasesorry for wall of text too pissed to format it was a ranti really need as many views as possible i have to know if this is a situation where waiting might work she loved her ex even though he made her feel unwanted he told her that he would come back to her i really dont want to wait on her just to find out she went back to him hes not a terrible guy hes just too flirty to make her feel secure he wants to make all girls feel beautiful and wanted i just feel thats not fair to jacque shes my concern even though at this point she probably shouldnt be,3.0

68049,am i the only who gets more depressed about their own life after someone tells you about their plans like where theyre going or what theyre doing etc its like everytime someone talks about their life and the shit they get to do it makes me think about how shitty my life is and how i dont do shit with it i wish my life werent so fucking boring and i dont have much control to change it cause i have parents and theyre overprotective i usually spend my free time alone in my room on the internet for hours if i wanted to go out with friends my parents wouldnt let me its gotten to the point where id rather just stay home cause ive gotten so used to it all i ever fuckng do is go to school everday from mondayfriday saturday is the only day that i can have to myself and i usually spend that time alone in my room then on sunday i go to church but thats only cause my parents make me go i dont rlly enjoy church all that much and when others tell me like what they did over the week i get fucking envious because i wish my life were as exciting as theirs i dont do shit and ppl tell me to do something about it but i cant cause of my fucking parents especially my mom like she would tell me to go out more but the moment i ask her if i can go out she makes me stay home like i dont get that shit and this is only on a rare occasion because i dont go out often but once in a while i do feel like going outside the way my life is and how it repeats itself every week is so fucking boring and its making me so depressed i hate myself so much i even have thoughts of wanting to die sometimes because i hate living like this but im too scared to tell my therapist because i dont know what they might do i just wish my life were fucking exciting and maybe i would be less sad,3.0

68070,being numb is underrated its funny to me how you can lose yourself feel completely numb feel entirely lost feel paralyzed almost to the point you dont even remember who you were as a person before not even realizing how broken you are anymore and all it takes is one moment one thing to make you feel again to show you how broken you are to show you who you are as a person again but that exact same thing can also ruin you being brought out of that state its almost laughable how damaging it can be how liberating it feels at first then that crushing weight that just comes back but you have no clue how to deal with it anymore that you just cant get back to that state you were in before probably because you dont want to anymore because you never felt human living like that it just seems like a cruel joke to me that the same thing that made me happy for the first time in my life and saved me at one point also is what ended up allowing everything else to swallow me ,3.0

68078,i dont want to cure my depression since i was a kid i was a very social being i loved receiving attention and feeling like the center of everyones life and it was easy to have it since i had a lot of friends and could easily build relationships with othershowever when i changed to a new school i was so terrified not to have friends that all my social skills were gone i only had two friends that came with me from our former school but one of them was special we looked like sisters i was always with her and we were so happy however a year later when we went to high school in the same college she decided to change so she started going out with my other friend who was popular and quickly forgot me i ignored her for a long time almost  months to see if she noticed i was not ok she didnt when i confronted her about it because my mom made me she simply didnt give a single fuck about if i spoke to her or not we had a special bond and it didnt mean anything to her this was so traumatic to me that until these days i cant believe when people say they like meright after that i met a guy to make this shorter i started liking him he said he liked me too this was the closest thing i had to a romantic relationship but he kept putting me down and had another girl they didnt date seriously he made fun of my sense of humor my hobbies my personality and everything about me which made my insecurities worse i told him to forget me and i would forget him but i never did he graduated high school i saw him twice last year and it would hurt me even remembering his name i still suffer today because of himafter all this i developed depression when i was  i scratched my arms with a mechanical pencil which left me scars even if it happened about  years ago i made some new friends but i was too wrecked inside i felt worthless and had no self esteem the only thing i felt i could really use to have attention again was my constant melancholy and suicidal thoughts being depressed was now part of my personality i would make self depreciating jokes all the time always telling people how i wanted to die but no one seemed to care it became something so trivial people wouldnt even take it seriously anyone that acted the way i did received attention and i didnt which made me feel worse my parents only knew about how i felt when some friends of mine got worried and talked to the school that talked to me and my mother i didnt want them to know because i felt like they wouldnt get me my friends never tried to talk to me even when i stopped talking to them because they thought i would ignore them i started my treatment with meds on april last year but still didnt get better until today i dont get completely happy why because i dont want to if im cured ill be back to that personality i hated so much ill lose my identity people will stop caring about me again not like they do right now i wont be myself im afraid to be bored or something like that if im not sad anymore and that kinda ruins me ive been better since i graduated high school and ill soon be starting psychology college maybe i can understand whats going on with me i hopebut please do not do what i do im aware that the only thing i get by not trying to get better if constant sadness and lack of will to live im in psychiatric and psychological treatment and if you feel like me i suggest you go seek treatment do not let depression define who you are,3.0

68486,i know theres more to life out there but what why am i so frustrated let me start by saying that ive always been a creative person from studio arts to music dance whatever relates to art ive had a lot of different exposure to ive also suffered from depression as a result of moving to the states as a young and only child although i always seemed like i coped well this move destroyed any self confidence that i ever held bullying yay i always felt so alien even though people cant even tell that i wasnt born here at this point of my life it still affects me to this day my depression likes to change and form into different ways depending on what situation i am going through in high school i invested myself in my studies and kept myself busy like the high functioning kid that i was in my sophomore year of college i completely crashed pulled out the first c in my lifefour times i graduated and mid panic of what to do reapplied to stay at my school for graduate school in order to avoid the real world now in my second semester of graduate school for a major i dont really care aboutagainim at a state where i dont know what the point of anything is ive written off marriage and children already but every single day i sit in my room and feel alone im happy when im with my friends but because most of them are gone i just sit there and wonder how i can fix this join more clubs i know this university so well and yet i dont know what to do i feel like my creativity is being stifled and i can do so much more but the real world scares me the thought of sitting in an office form  makes me hurl how can anyone live like that i get frustrated i accomplish small goals yet theres no end game im not living for anything but my parents who i get to see twice a month i just constantly feel like theres nothing that i like to particularly do and what i like to do in the creative field is close to impossible to survive on or anything that i because of who i am would be able to doi dont want to have a family in the future and yet i feel lonely job and internship hunting season is coming up and although i have no desire to go back home to my parents very lonely and boring i also have no desire to go find work that im not excited about and spend  hours behind a desk i know i have to do it money doesnt grow on trees but i justcant i dont even know what im writing theres just so much going on in my head all at once its hard to even put it into words i have no real goals to work towards ive led a very successful life good university graduated great family blah blah but i cant seem to get a solid goal of what i want out of my life im just so frustrated i dont know what to do and how to navigate through this first week back at uni and i already feel school work slipping through my fingers for absolutely no reason but a lack of motivation i need direction ,3.0

68503,i dont know whether i am depressed hi guystldr i am bored with everything in life i believe that i should be doing something with my life but i dont i have some suicidal thoughts there are days when im really motivated but i end up crashing after that and entering a poor mindset again long postfor the past few weeks ive begun to question whether ive been depressed or not ive had generally the same mindset for the past few years but it was only recently someone mentioned that i might have depression essentially im extremely bored with life i wake up every day and i dont see any purpose to get out of bed if it were not for societal pressure like my parents i feel like i would lay in bed all day since i wouldnt have the will to do anything else i dont get pleasure out of doing things i once enjoyed doing back when i was younger however although i have this mindset i still feel like i should live i feel like im just in a rut and i need to get out before i started thinking like this i used to be a very optimistic outgoing person so maybe this is carrying over to my thought process now i will mention that i do sometimes have suicidal thoughts like why dont i just end my life if i am so bored then all of the boringness will leave and ill put myself out of this rutand finally there are days where i feel extremely motivated to do things i feel good on those days but after the motivation goes awayi just crash and end up feeling the same or worse that before thanks for taking the time to read i am going to end on the questionhow do i definitively know if i am depressed,3.0

68686,a good story so for the last year things have just been going downhill it started with losing my best friend in the worst way i can imagine they just stoped talking to me so i started talking to another really close frend then the best frend came back after about  months of ignoring me and was really angry claming id replaced them i then turned to self harm ik this is a stupid thing to start self harming about but i am very limited in frends so that sucked then i came out as transgender because my exbest frend was notorusoly homophobic so i was always scared and repressed that part of me just ended up depressed and that started getting better when i came out but what do ya know my family wasnt the happiest and that got blamed on my arsbergers totally and ruined me seeing myself positively and seeing arsbegers as good with some bad but yeah then my chosen carers got shit on because of my arsbegers making them unrealsitic as my family said so yeah my frends that i had started ingmoring me cause i was always having to vent to someone in order to keep my self from ending my own life and i was pretty much a lost cause to everyone that knew my mental issues even though they didnt say it it was clear thats what people were thinking but after about  days of reading reddit and posting all the time getting advice and storys from everyone else here im totally contented il admit im still not happy but spam posting and reading things also reading some stuff from rsuicidewatch  have braught me to this point where im like im not exactly happy but i dont really need to be do i and i hope this lasts if not well ive got plenty more to post about ive not self harmed since i relapsed  weeks ago however before then i went  months so small victories a guess its been helpful though i wont lie because im very clumbsy and tent to acidentaly injure myself but now i dont judge my clumbsy ness infact im quite greatful because i means i can avoid purpusfuly self harming and still gain relief so yay small victorys but yeahthings were really bad but now there toliable thanks to all of you guys indirectly helping me and i hope one day i can do it for someone else ruby samantha holmes,3.0

68894,my poem about depression depression isbeing tired all day but not sleeping at night my emotions being so low and the next moment they take flight when something isnt working and it feels like a personal attackwhen something so small can set me so far back when there are days when my will to live is sick withered and black the guilt i feel for burdening peoples lives with the flaws of my personality coping with it by laughing at it casually not wanting to pick up phone calls listen to voicemails or answer texts not wanting to do anything cause sometimes i just wished i were dead there even when my life is filled with laughter love and everything i could want i swear it has nothing to do with you mom the guilt again because whats there to be depressed about you have a good family and a warm house in my head my heart i feel it in my body  killing me from the inside i can feel myself rotting the most beautiful minds are capable of the ugliest thoughts even if i lose this fight aleast i could say i fought note  i had a really bad month in november almost admitted myself it was the first time i had felt that way since in over a year i felt balanced and content during the duration of my pregnancy and even after birth but after returning to work when my baby turned  months old i slowly started to deteriorate and return to my prepregnancy state,3.0

68917,gotta get this off my chest if anyone wants to read a  journey of recovery   years ago i started having suicidal thoughts i was officially diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety in  and have been on regular meds and therapy since i had wanted to be a vet since i was  years old but at  i thought i would never make it past  i struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts from  to about  ive had  suicide attempts ranging from mild to serious ranging from pills to heights to razor cuts ive got scars all over my arms and thighs from the times i thought the pain was too much to bear i still vividly remember a time in my life when my voices haunted me telling me to prove to people that i actually did want to die so that they would start taking me seriously and i climbed over the balcony and sat on the ledge for  crying out to god to send someone to save me he didnt send anyone and i had to call  numbers before eventually someone picked up and rescued me i was fired from my internship in  and my job a year later and felt there was no hope left i didnt want to go to school anymore i didnt want to be a vet anymore i just wanted to end my life i applied for vet school in  even tho i was incredibly burnt out and broken from being bullied by my colleagues miraculously i was accepted into my dream schoolive passed  for a few months now its still a bit jarring knowing that the end of the road i had set myself when i was  wasnt actually the end of the road after all its weird not having voices lashing out at me beating me up for making even the slightest mistake callously insulting me at any time its even stranger having voices that soothe and heal my hurt when im broken its still very difficult i cant lie sometimes i struggle to get out of bed or to eat or even to shower sometimes i still feel the urge to self harm two months cleanbut if i was to be honest i appreciate what depression has done for me its taught me how incredibly precious life is its taught me how to love and nurture and care for the people around me and the animals too its taught me to take joy in the simplest of things even if the day was total bullshit and trust me on this bc ive been splattered with cow shit before i know it sounds preachy but i truly believe that humans have the capacity to grow and learn from any experiences that were dealt with just felt like i needed to get this off my chest at  in the morning ,3.0

69011,my boyfriend of years and i broke up and hes going through something how do i help him im going through a really rough time right now and he broke up with me because he said he could no longer handle taking care of someone else he wanted to be alone and independent and not have to worry about me he says i wouldnt understand because im not independent but were only  although i might be able to remain loyal he admits he might not once we go off to college he says he wants other girls to like him even though he cant like any girls back and he cant be with me because he doesnt want to disrespect me he says hes depressed and he doesnt want to be around anyone including his family yet he also says he wants to make friends and have everyone like him he wants to be the idea of perfect and have people want him i want him and i always show him how much i love him and how much i care he says he loves me and he knows im the best thing for him and that id never hurt him but that im not enough ive been with him for years and although our relationship has been rocky and he hasnt been the most loyal in the past i know hes going through something weve gone through things but we were also very happy hes insecure and says not many people like him and im sure its affecting him in some way no he doesnt treat me the best sometimes and he did break up with me while i am going through an awful time but i still cant help but worry about him he said we shouldnt talk or see each other but after everything hes told me about him being insecure and him just wanting to be perfect for people to like him im worried  hes been distant and he constantly wants to be alone but i dont know what to do to help i cant help if he wont let me but i feel like i need to do something because im the only one aware of any of this as difficult as it is to move on its even more difficult knowing he might possibly need me and i just am unsure of what to do to help,3.0

69030,i love winter when i was a child i used to love summertime the freedom from school the warm weather bike riding with my friends playing stickball ice cream trucks everywhere baseball games on tv every night free tv not cable i hated winter because you couldnt go outside without being bundled up my bike was in the garage and there was endless school i remember how the first warm days of springtime made my heart soar the possibilities were endless anything seemed possible but now im middle aged and worn down by so many disappointments that life has shown me so many times my heart has been broken so many dreams of my youth shattered and now i prefer the winter the bitter cold and the snow and ice i prefer them because when its cold outside with snow drifts everywhere people are shut inside their homes so when i walk the streets i dont have to see the pretty girls in their summer dresses and be reminded of every time i loved in vain i dont have to see the playing jumping laughing children without a care in the world and be reminded that i was once one of them before my world began to darken with bitterness and depression and regret and despair i dont have to see the young couples walking arm in arm and talking to each other and laughing or seeing them in the park holding each other close and be reminded how much and for how long ive yearned for love to be held close to be someones whole world to be someones special guy only to be rejected again and again and again i dont want to be reminded that i havent been kissed or embraced by a woman for years decades i dont want to be reminded of everything i once dreamed of having but never got and now with more years behind me than ahead will likely never have no more summers give me frigid cold give me snow and ice give me wind chill factors below zero keep everyone inside their homes it is the only way my pain can be eased ,3.0

69148,my friend needs help but refuses to get help long i am not sure if this is the correct subreddit since i have anxiety and my friend have depression but i want to understand how to help my friend so posting it herei have a close friend with depression and for years i dont know how to give her the help she needs a brief backgroundwe are besties since kindergarden and growing up i have severe anxiety still do and she has depression our family backgrounds are very different my parents are controlling but they are the type to helicopter me and made me really dependent and anxious they are middleincome people with comfortable saving and were pretty ok i grew up with no sense of independence and empathy due this upbringing though my friends family is also extremely controlling her mom is quite literally insane and super judgy racist elitist clingy and paranoid she doesnt believe in mental health at all and is a control freak her dad is a cheater her brother has anger management issues waves knives around when hes angry they have no savings and the entire family is toxic to each other my friend is kind really sympathetic to people and stick close to her family because she is worried about them she is almost  and has no job no savings all her money she gave away to her other friends or family who needs it more than her her friends and her brother all have jobs she spends all her free time helping them out she feels like she cant get a job because she hasnt graduated from community college and she is overweight i tell her over and over again to stop giving her family money but she refuses to listen because it makes her feel good  the current issuei eventually got a hold of my life and got an ok paying job to move out of my house but the only way it happened was my parents  paying my way through private school where i learn in a close classroom environment basically i got babied hard and i cant emphasize with someone with a harder background after moving out i got a circle of friends that hates my best friend they tried to bring her into the circle before but because my friend is a social justice warrior the type that when we see a movie she complains about the lack of female presence instead of just enjoying it as a cool action flick and also usually dont have the energy to do much else besides movies note they are not bad friends they tried for years to help her mentally but my friend wont change so eventually they gave up hanging out with my friend  my new circle of friends is difficult because my friend tries too hard to make everyone feels welcome and it gets tiring so i am stuck in the middle and recently it has gotten exhausting myself to hang out with my friend i love her and i know she is the kindest person i know but she is not willing to change her ways and get help every time i hang out with her i have to initiate the activity what do i want to eat what movie do i want to watch how is my life going i talk to my friend about topics or tried to initiate a conversation that is not about social justice and about her the conversation usually goes well i help my family did this and i am depressed i help my friend do this and i am depressed it is always her giving and giving and giving i want her to be more assertive i want her to get more confident i am really heartbroken that we are slowly slipping apart and i dont know how to help i am a very anxious person i can barely help myself and i tried to just listen but i listened for years already i want her to get therapy but she doesnt have a job i want her to move out from her abusive family but she doesnt have the financial means and also she wants to move out with crazy brother because she felt sorry for him too i hate her brother because he takes advantage of her splits the price of a psp but only he gets to play it i even offer to pay for one therapy session i dont have a lot of savings but she refuses any money help she keeps sneaking me money or gifts everytime i get her something and i want her to stop i even give her ultimatums to stop giving me stuff and i know she asks her parents for the money since she doesnt have a job she is almost  and spent  years in community college her only wish in life is to be a psychologist and she said she rather waste away than to work other jobs i dont know what to do anymore and i hope you guys and shed a light to this situation im sorry if this is a long read i am ok with my friend taking baby steps towards improving her life but as she got older she stopped caring,3.0

69153,having difficult time maintaining friends im a party animal on the inside but am still an introvert i like going to raves but only hang out within my somewhat existing social group its not a very strong group i like smoking weed alone id love to smoke weed with others but it always end up not being as fun as i thoughton the other hand i study engineering am pretty politically engaged and am a feminist i dont know if im judgmental or what but i always end up not liking something about the friends i make and i slowly drift apart from them after noticing our differenceslike if im going to a rave with some people if the group is super responsible and constantly being paranoid about drugs its not fun on the other hand for my other small group of friends who are totally okay with doing drugs and having a fun time they always just scatter away they go off doing their own thingwhen i try to smoke weed with other people they are either potheads who are really dirty like literally dirty with filthy rooms filthy bongs just yuck or really reserved and start acting like theyre gonna die after one small puff of smoke as for the friends i made within my engineering major they make great conversation partners about things pertaining to our major but we dont have anything else in commoni tend to be politically engaged but i try to stay as neutral as i can although i personally lean left i dont usually comment on political things vocally to my friends the ones who do are the ones who just make fun or trump or something and also the part about me being a feminist i have been around a lot of guys lately they might be rave buddies or people at my school  are sexist theyre not some extreme misogynists or something but they always drop those bombs like its okay if you cant do it youre a girl or girls just lack those qualities guys are just better at it or wow youre so smart kudos to doing super trivial task i do call them out on their bs and hypocrisy but regardless i cant really see myself hanging out with those types of people in the long runi dont know what to do i have no friends to hang out with i might be judgmental i might just be more aware of myself theres always a void thats not filled when i hang out with friends if we click in one aspect they always lack in other aspects stopping me from wanting to make life long friendships with the personwhat do other people do do you just accept those other qualities and continue hanging out with the person even though you have conflicting standardswhat should i do should i go to raves with the boring group should i go to raves and just hang out alone after everyone scatters should i smoke weed with others even if its no fun should i ignore sexist comments and just brush it off  should i continue doing superficial stuff with people i dont have much in common with should i stop caring about politics or womens rights  or should i just wait for the perfect person to come to me whom may not exist in this world im not asking sarcastic questions i literally dont know how to maintain these friendships ,3.0
69154,how much support is it fair to expect of my significant other without overwhelming him cw super brief mention of self harm so my bf and i are in our late   and have been together a bit less than  months he seems to care about me and has told me he loves me and im pretty sure i love him its hard to tell because ive been so apathetic and depressed recently early in our relationship i let him know that ive been dealing with depression and anxiety and have been on meds for that since i was young and am still trying to figure out the best way to manage it because i feel like thats something i want to be honest about in a relationship he seemed very understanding and asked me to tell him if i was ever feeling depressed or feel like i want to hurt myself again and asked if he could do anything to support me ive only told him how i was feeling  or  times hell ask how im doing and ill say ive been feeling saddepressedoff lately or something every time he either doesnt respond or responds and doesnt acknowledge what ive said he rarely asks how im doing he generally only asks after ive asked i really wish hed say something like ask if he can give me a hug even but theres been nothing literally nothing i dont want to burden him so i dont know how much to actually tell him and what i can ask him to do to support me i know hes not my therapist or a suicide hotline or whatever but i thought he since he wanted to know that telling him would mean he would respond ive been single for years because i didnt want to put my shit on anyone else and now im feeling like that was a smart idea i feel like he doesnt care and its really hurting ive been doing my best with therapyvisits to the psychiatristtaking my meds but how much can i reasonably expect of him i sometimes just need comfort and im so scared of asking too much any advice would be super appreciated ,3.0

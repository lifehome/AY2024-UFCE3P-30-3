We would like to thank the uploading user and author(s), as well as the people contributing in this dataset.

## Methodology

We will first perform text-preprocessing with "Tokenization & cleaning" step, followed by stratified sampling against the training and testing set of data. After that, TF-IDF will be used to vectorize the text before further processed by each algorithm.

The selected algorithm for supervised classifiers in this project are:
1. Na√Øve Bayes - (Multinomial)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine - (Linear)
4. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
